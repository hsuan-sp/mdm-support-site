**This is a common classroom management headache. Beyond 'Blocking Changes,' you need a 'Batch Renaming' tool to quickly correct your entire fleet.**

## The Three-Step Solution:

### 1. Stop the Bleed: Disable Local Modification

- In the Jamf Pro **Restrictions** profile, **uncheck** `Allow modifying device name`.
- **Result**: The "Name" field in **Settings > General > About** will turn gray and become unclickable.

### 2. The Treatment: Batch Rename with 'The MUT'

To correct hundreds of already-mislabeled iPads, use **The MUT (Mass Update Tool)**.

- **Download**: Search for "The MUT" in the Mac App Store (Free tool developed by Jamf employees).

- **Action**:
  1. Prepare a CSV with two columns: **Serial Number** and **Device Name**.
  2. Open The MUT, log in with your Jamf Pro credentials.
  3. Upload the CSV and click **Update**.
  4. The system will instantly push renaming commands to all targeted devices.

### 3. Prevention: Enforce Naming

Enable **Enforce Mobile Device Name** in your smart groups or device records in Jamf Pro.

- **Result**: This background mechanism monitors the fleet. If a device name deviates from the record (e.g., if a student bypasses a restriction), the MDM automatically pushes a correction command.

## Practical Advice:

For future deployments, define your naming convention (e.g., `Class-2026-%SERIALNUMBER%`) directly within the **PreStage Enrollment** settings. New devices will be named automatically upon activation without any manual effort.
