**Activation Lock for Macs with Apple Silicon (M1-M5) or the Apple T2 Security Chip is fully integrated into Apple School Manager (ASM).**

The key to unlocking it depends on which organization currently owns the serial number in Apple's database.

## Option 1: The serial number is in your ASM list

If the serial number appears in ASM (common for original-unit repairs):

1. Log in to **ASM** > **Devices** > Search for the serial number.

2. Click **Manage Activation Lock > Turn off Activation Lock**.
3. **Result**: Wait about 10 minutes, restart the Mac, and connect to Wi-Fi. The lock will be cleared via Apple's servers.

## Option 2: The serial number is NOT in ASM (Retail unit/New board)

If the repair involved a new logic board that wasn't auto-transferred to your ASM:

1. **Tools**: Use another Mac with **Apple Configurator** or an iPhone with the **Apple Configurator app**.

2. **Steps**: Put the target Mac on the "Setup Assistant" (Hello) screen. Use the iPhone app to scan the cloud pattern or the Mac app to **Add to Apple School Manager**.
3. **Follow-up**: Once the serial appears in your ASM, proceed with **Option 1**.

## Option 3: The 'Locked to Another Organization' scenario

If the repair shop used a "pre-owned" or "test" board that is still managed by another school or enterprise:

- **Symptom**: Apple Configurator will throw an error saying "This device is owned by another organization."

- **Risk**: **You cannot unlock this yourself.** Legally and technically, the hardware ownership remains with another entity.
- **Fix**: Demand that the repair vendor either contacts the original owner for a "Release" in ASM or replaces the board with a clean, unmanaged unit.

## Last Resort: DFU Mode Restore

If the unlock command has been sent but the Mac remains stuck:

1. Put the Mac into **DFU Mode**.

2. Connect to another Mac (Finder/Configurator) or Windows PC (Apple Devices app).
3. Perform a **Restore**. This reflashes firmware and wipes the drive. If the ASM unlock was successful, the Mac will now activate normally.
