**When using 'Shared iPad' deployments, teachers should trigger a 'Log Out' action at the end of class to prepare the devices for the next group of users.**

## How to Operate:

In the **Classroom** app, tap **End Class** in the top left and confirm **Log Out Students**.

## Technical Logic (Based on Apple Official Specs):

### 1. Session Termination

- The log-out command forces the device back to the login screen.
- This prevents upcoming users from accessing the previous student's app windows or local drafts, ensuring data privacy.

### 2. Intelligent Caching

- **Definition**: Data is **not** immediately deleted from the device after log-out; it is retained in the iPad's local storage.
- **Purpose**: If the same student happens to use the **same iPad** next time, the system reads the local cache, enabling a "near-instant login."
- **OS 26 Enhancement**: Under the latest architecture, hardware-accelerated user switching has reduced log-in/out cycle times by approximately 30% compared to older versions.

### 3. Cloud Sync

- **Correction**: Syncing data happens continuously in the background; it is **not** triggered by the log-out action itself. Even if the network is unstable during log-out, data remains safely cached locally. Once the device is connected to Wi-Fi and idle, the system automatically completes the iCloud upload.

## Practical Advice:

While Intelligent Caching exists, if storage runs low, the system will automatically purge the "oldest" user cache. Therefore, critical work should always be saved to cloud storage (Google Drive / OneDrive) to be safe.
