**You can disable 'Allow App Removal' in a Restrictions profile, but be mindful of the difference between 'Deleting' and 'Removing from Home Screen'.**

## Configuration:

In the Jamf Pro **Restrictions** profile, uncheck **Allow removing apps**.

## Practical Effects:

1. **Deletion Blocked**: When a student long-presses an app icon, the red "Delete App" option will **not appear** in the menu.

2. **Removal from Home Screen (Critical Detail)**:
   - Even if deletion is blocked, students can still select **Remove from Home Screen**, which hides the app in the "App Library" on the far right.
   - **Solution**: To prevent "hidden apps," pair this with a **Home Screen Layout** profile to pin icons permanently to the desktop.

## Practical Advice:

For younger students or shared iPads, we recommend always enabling this restriction to prevent the accidental loss of educational software mid-lesson.
