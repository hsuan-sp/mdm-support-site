**MDM cannot detect or block the 'setting' of specific alarms, but you can solve the problem by 'Hiding the App'.**

## Why can't we manage alarms directly?

The Apple MDM protocol does not grant permissions to read or modify local alarm settings. Therefore, an administrator cannot remotely delete a student's set alarms or prevent them from ringing.

## Strategic Solutions:

1. **Hide the Clock App (Most Effective)**:
   - In Jamf Pro, add `com.apple.mobiletimer` (the Clock App Bundle ID) to your **Restricted Software** list or a "Hide Apps" profile.
   - **Result**: The Clock icon disappears. Students cannot set new alarms. _(Note: Alarms set before the app was hidden may still ring; see below.)_

2. **Reset All Settings**:
   - If an alarm is already set and ringing, perform a remote **Reset All Settings** command (this clears settings/alarms without deleting user data).

3. **Jamf Teacher 'App Restrictions'**:
   - During class, teachers can use Jamf Teacher to "Allow only Educational Apps," which temporarily hides the Clock app and prevents interference.
