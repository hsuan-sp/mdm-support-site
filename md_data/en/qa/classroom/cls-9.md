**MDM can enforce an 'Auto-Lock' timeout, but it 'cannot' directly control screen brightness.**

According to Apple's MDM protocol specifications:

## 1. Auto-Lock

- **Manageable**: Administrators can use a configuration profile (Passcode Payload) to enforce a specific "Timeout before Auto-Lock" (e.g., force locking after 5 minutes of inactivity).
- **Advice**: Set this to between 2 and 5 minutes. Too short interferes with reading; too long wastes battery.

## 2. Screen Brightness

- **NOT Manageable**: Currently, there is no MDM command to lock brightness at a specific percentage (e.g., 50%). This is by design to ensure accessibility and visibility across varying lighting environments.
- **Advice**: Teachers should instruct students to enable "Auto-Brightness" or manually adjust it via Control Center.

## 3. Wallpaper

- **Manageable**: MDM can unify the Lock Screen and Home Screen wallpapers (Supervised devices only). This helps in identifying school assets visually.
