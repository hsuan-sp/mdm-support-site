**macOS 26 explicitly labels privacy permissions (Camera, Mic, Screen Recording) that are managed by the organization in System Settings.**

## Interface Changes

### Pre-macOS 26 (Before macOS 15 Sequoia)

- Users saw toggles as grayed out but often didn't know _why_.
- Permission switches were simply locked without explanation.

### macOS 26

- Displays a badge: **"Managed by [Organization Name]"**.
- Displays management icons.
- Users can see what has been authorized but still cannot change it, but now they know it is set by the school.

## Common Questions and Response Angles

### "Why is the Microphone forced ON?"

- Response: This ensures apps like Zoom, Google Meet, or recording software for language classes work instantly.
- Having the permission does not mean it is "Recording"—macOS still shows a hardware-level **Orange Light** whenever the mic is active (this cannot be bypassed by software).

### "Is Screen Recording for monitoring me?"

- Response: This allows students to share their screen during presentations or remote lab sessions.
- Having the permission allows the app to share; it does not mean continuous monitoring.
- macOS displays a **Green indicator** when the screen is being shared or recorded.

### "Why can't I turn it OFF?"

- Response: Managing these via MDM ensures that critical educational tools don't fail due to a student accidentally clicking "Deny."
- This reduces the support burden of repeatedly troubleshooting permission prompts.

## Practical Advice:

### Preparation

- List the permissions the school has set and explain the purpose of each.
- Prepare an FAQ for students/staff.
- Explain that this is a new design feature of macOS 26, not a new monitoring initiative.

### Response Principles

- Acknowledge that privacy concerns are valid.
- Explain the pedagogical necessity of each permission.
- Emphasize macOS's built-in protections (hardware indicators, notifications).
