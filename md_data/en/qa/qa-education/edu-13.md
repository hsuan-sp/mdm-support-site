**Yes. iPadOS 13.4 and later fully support mice, trackpads, and Bluetooth/USB keyboards, providing a laptop-like experience.**

## Keyboard Support:

Keyboards work instantly upon pairing. Command-key shortcuts (like Cmd+C/V) function similarly to a Mac.

## Mouse and Trackpad Support:

1. **Pairing**: Go to **Settings > Bluetooth** and put your mouse in pairing mode.
2. **Cursor**: Once connected, a circular cursor appears on the screen. It "snaps" to buttons and changes shape (e.g., turning into a bar for text editing).
3. **USB Mice**: USB-C iPads support wired mice directly (or via a USB-A adapter). Lightning iPads require a "Lightning to USB Camera Adapter."

## Customization:

Go to **Settings > Accessibility > Pointer Control** to adjust the cursor size, contrast, scrolling speed, and "Secondary Click" (Right-click) behavior.
