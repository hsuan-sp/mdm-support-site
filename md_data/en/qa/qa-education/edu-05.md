**Most 'slowness' is caused by software fatigue rather than hardware failure. Regular maintenance steps can restore the device to its original speed.**

## Troubleshooting Checklist:

1. **Reboot (The Most Important Step)**:
   - iPads are often left on for weeks at a time. A simple **Hard Restart** clears out memory leaks and hung background processes. **Tip**: We recommend every student reboots their iPad once a week.

2. **Storage Overload**:
   - Check **Settings > General > iPad Storage**. If the device has less than **2GB** of free space, iPadOS will slow down significantly as it struggles to manage temporary files. Ask the student to delete large personal videos or unused games.

3. **Background Activity (Apple Intelligence)**:
   - On newer iPads (M-series, iPadOS 18-26), the system may be indexing data for school-managed AI features. If the iPad is warm and slow after a major update, plug it into power and leave it on Wi-Fi overnight to finish the process.

4. **Browser Fatigue**:
   - Students often have 50+ tabs open in Safari. Closing all tabs and clearing the history/metadata (**Settings > Safari > Clear History**) can instantly improve web-based learning performance.

5. **Operating System Version**:
   - Ensure the device is running the latest allowed version of iPadOS. Apple regularly releases patches that optimize performance for older hardware.

## When to contact the ICT Support Team:

If the device is still slow after a reboot and a storage cleanup, or if the screen is behaving erratically (ghost touching), it may have a failing digitizer or battery. At this point, the device should be sent to the ICT Support Team for a hardware diagnostic.
