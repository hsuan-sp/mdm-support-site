title: "If a school changes MDM providers, is it mandatory to wipe all iPads?"

**Prior to 2026, the answer was yes. However, with the release of iOS 26 (Tahoe), Apple introduced 'Zero-Wipe MDM Migration.' If specific conditions are met, schools can migrate from Provider A to Provider B without erasing data or re-downloading apps.**

## Comparison: Traditional vs. Zero-Wipe Migration

| Feature             | **Traditional Migration (Legacy)** | **Zero-Wipe Migration (iOS 26+)**               |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Retention**  | All data wiped (must backup).      | **Full Retention** (files, settings, apps).     |
| **User Experience** | Must redo the Setup Assistant.     | **Silent Background Process** (needs internet). |
| **Network Impact**  | Massive (GBs of app downloads).    | **Minimal** (Management permission swap only).  |
| **Time per Device** | 30–60 minutes.                     | **2–5 minutes**.                                |

## Requirements for Zero-Wipe Migration

1. **OS Version**: All devices must be on **iOS/macOS 26** or later.
2. **DEP/ADE Support**: Devices must be owned in **Apple School Manager (ASM)** with Automated Device Enrollment.
3. **DDM Support**: Both the old and new MDM servers must support the **MDM Migration Payload** (Declarative Device Management).

## Why 'Zero-Wipe' can be Risky (The Expert View)

Even though the feature is available, education technology experts often consider it a **last resort** rather than a best practice.

- **'Profile Ghosting'**: Legacy settings from the old MDM (like specific Wi-Fi certificates or restrictions) can sometimes linger, creating "conflicts" with the new MDM policies that are difficult to troubleshoot.

- **VPP Licensing Lock**: Handing off app management is fragile. If the old MDM doesn't release the VPP license cleanly before the new one takes over, apps may stop updating or prompt students for a password.
- **Accumulated Technical Debt**: A wipe provides a "fresh start" for the filesystem. A migration carries over years of system logs and cache clutter, which can impact performance on older devices like the iPad 9.

## Expert Recommendation:

- **Use Zero-Wipe WHEN**: You must migrate in the middle of a semester with zero downtime and the devices contain critical teacher data that cannot be backed up.
- **Use Wipe & Re-enroll WHEN**: It is the summer break. A clean reset via **EACS (Erase All Content and Settings)** is the only way to guarantee 100% policy compliance and peak device performance for the new school year.

## Summary

While technology has made "Zero-Wipe" possible, a **clean start** remains the gold standard for IT management stability.
