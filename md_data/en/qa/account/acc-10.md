**This involves a major underlying system change.** Since the format of a Managed Apple Account changes with the domain, it directly affects user login identities.

## Pre-Migration Assessment:

- **Timing**: Strongly recommended to perform this during **long breaks (Summer/Winter)**. After the change, old accounts on all devices will become invalid, requiring re-login.
- **Data Continuity**: The unique internal ID of the Apple Account remains the same, so cloud data (iCloud Drive, Photos) will migrate with the new account name, but users must "Sign Out and Sign Back In" to regain access.

## Procedure:

### Step 1: Add and Verify the New Domain

1. Log in to Apple School Manager ([school.apple.com](https://school.apple.com)).
2. Go to **Preferences > Accounts** (or "User Sign-in & Directory Sync").
3. In the Domains section, click **Add** and enter the new domain (e.g., `@school.xh.edu.tw`).
4. Follow the instructions to add a TXT record to your DNS settings. Once verified, the domain can be assigned to users.

### Step 2: Batch Update Account Formats

- **For Manually Managed Accounts**:
  1. Export all users as a CSV from the "Users" list.
  2. Find & Replace the domain part of the "Managed Apple Account" column in the CSV with the new domain.
  3. Re-upload the updated CSV via the import function.

- **For Federated Authentication (Google / Microsoft)**:
  1. **Critical Order**: You must first complete the email domain migration on the Google or Microsoft side.
  2. Return to ASM to trigger a re-sync.
  3. ASM will detect the email changes and automatically update the corresponding Managed Apple Accounts.

### Step 3: Client-Side Action

- **Forced Re-login**: After the change, iPhones/iPads will prompt "Account Verification Failed" or request a password.
- **Correct Action**: Users should manually sign out of the old domain account and then sign in using the **new email format** (password usually remains unchanged).

## Important Notes:

- **Federation Conflicts**: If the new domain has already been used by staff/students for personal Apple Accounts, enabling federation will trigger the **60-day conflict resolution process**, requiring those users to change their personal account emails.
- **VPP Licenses**: App licenses are tied to the account's internal ID, so changing the domain does not cause license loss.
- **Shared iPad**: If deploying Shared iPad, the login screen will automatically update to reflect the domain change; students simply need to enter their new credentials.

## Practical Advice:

Before rolling this out globally, manually update 2-3 test accounts (e.g., IT staff) to verify that iCloud data and MDM commands continue to function correctly after switching domains.
