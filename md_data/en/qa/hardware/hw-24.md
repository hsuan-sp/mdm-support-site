**With the introduction of M4/M5 iPads and Macs, school networks are now 'Tri-generational.' Handling Wi-Fi 6, 6E, and 7 simultaneously requires careful planning to prevent newer devices from being throttled while ensuring older iPads (like the iPad 9) remain connected.**

## Wi-Fi Tech Specs Comparison:

| Generation             | Main Bands | Max Theory Speed | Key Tech            | Education Devices       |
| :--------------------- | :--------- | :--------------- | :------------------ | :---------------------- |
| **Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)** | 2.4/5GHz   | 9.6 Gbps         | OFDMA, TWT          | iPad 9, iPad 10         |
| **Wi-Fi 6E**           | **+ 6GHz** | 9.6 Gbps         | 160MHz Width        | M4 iPad Pro, M3 MacBook |
| **Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be)** | 2.4/5/6GHz | **46 Gbps**      | MLO, 320MHz, 4K-QAM | M5 iPad Pro, iPhone 16  |

## Upgrade Planning Strategy:

### 1. Isolate 6GHz for High Performance

Newer M4/M5 devices support 6GHz (Wi-Fi 6E/7), which has almost zero interference.

- **Recommendation**: Create a separate SSID for 6GHz (e.g., `Roaming-HighSpeed`) for "Video Editing" or "VR Labs" that need high bandwidth and low latency.

### 2. WPA3 Compatibility

- **Mandatory**: Wi-Fi 6E/7 **requires** WPA3 encryption.
- **Legacy Risk**: Older iPads (5th/6th Gen) might struggle with WPA3.
- **Plan**: Keep a "Mixed Mode" (WPA2/WPA3) SSID for general classrooms.

### 3. Benefit of MLO (Multi-Link Operation)

Wi-Fi 7's MLO allows M5 iPad Pros to transmit on 5GHz and 6GHz simultaneously.

- **Benefit**: Even if Bluetooth interferes with one band, the stream continues uninterrupted on the other.

### 4. Infrastructure Bottleneck

- If upgrading to Wi-Fi 7 APs, your core switches must support **Multi-Gig (2.5GbE or 5GbE)**. Plugging a 46Gbps AP into a 1Gbps port is a waste of money.

## Practical Advice:

For most general classrooms, **Wi-Fi 6E** offers the best cost-performance ratio. Reserve **Wi-Fi 7** for "Future Labs" or multimedia centers where M5 devices are deployed.
