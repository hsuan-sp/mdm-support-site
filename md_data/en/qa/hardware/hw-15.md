**Starting with macOS 15, Apple introduced a new 'Media Management' framework that allows for granular control over external storage devices. macOS 26 (Tahoe) further strengthens this security.** Controlled USB access is vital in computer labs or administrative offices to prevent unauthorized file copying or malware injection.

## Important Background: macOS 26 (Tahoe) and Intel Mac End-of-Life:

- **Final Support**: macOS 26 is the **last supported version** for Intel-based Macs (announced WWDC 2025).
- **Eligible Models**: Only four Intel Macs can upgrade: 16" MacBook Pro (2019), 13" MacBook Pro (2020), iMac (2020), Mac Pro (2019).
- **Future**: Starting with macOS 27 (2026), only Apple Silicon is supported. Intel Macs get security updates until 2028.
- **Strategy**: Plan for Apple Silicon upgrades for computer labs.

## Implementation Strategies in Jamf Pro:

1. **Read-Only Mode**:
   - Set external drives to read-only. Students can read teaching materials from a flash drive but **cannot copy files out** of the computer.

2. **Full Block**:
   - For high-security administrative Macs, you can disable the mounting of external storage devices entirely.

3. **Thunderbolt Accessory Security**:
   - On Apple Silicon (M-series) Macs, you can restrict new Thunderbolt accessories to require "User Approval" or "Admin Authorization" for data transfer, preventing attacks.

## Practical Advice:

For Mac computer labs, administrators can create a Smart Group that automatically applies a "Block External Disks" profile during exam times, and reverts to normal read/write permissions afterwards.
