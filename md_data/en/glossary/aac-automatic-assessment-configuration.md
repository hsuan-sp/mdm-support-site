## Term Definition

**Automatic Assessment Configuration (AAC)** is a specialized lock-down mode in iOS, iPadOS, and macOS designed for high-stakes standardized testing.

When a student opens a supported testing app, AAC automatically manages the device environment:

- **Disables assistive features** : Dictionary, spell check, and lookup.

- **Blocks interruptions** : Screenshots, screen recording, and push notifications are suppressed.
- **Prevents multitasking** : The student is locked into the specific testing app.

Once the test is completed and the student exits the app, the device automatically restores all features without requiring manual IT intervention.

## Analogy

This is the iPad's **"Proctored Exam Mode"** .

When the test starts, the system temporarily **"confiscates"** all potential cheating tools (like copy-paste, Siri, or auto-correct). As soon as the test is over, these tools are automatically returned to the student, ensuring a fair and secure testing environment for everyone.
