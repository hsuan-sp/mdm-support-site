## Term Definition

Introduced in **OS version 26** , this core DDM mechanism allows for more sophisticated software governance. It supports the deployment of App Store apps, Custom apps, and **.pkg** packages for macOS.

Key management capabilities:

- **Required Apps** : Automatically installed and self-healed (cannot be permanently removed by users).

- **Optional Apps** : Available for users to download through a curated organizational portal.
- **Update Pinning** : Administrators can freeze high-stakes testing apps at a specific version to ensure stability.
- **Granular Control** : Detailed settings for forcing updates or disabling auto-updates per-application.

## Analogy

In the past, sending an app was like **"Delivering a package"** —once it arrived on the doorstep, the delivery driver's job was done.

Now, with DDM, it's more like a **"Managed Subscription Service."** You can set rules for each app (like "always keep this one updated" or "never update this version until I say so"), giving the school total control over the software students are using in the classroom.
