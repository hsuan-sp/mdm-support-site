## Term Definition

**QR Code Enrollment** is a streamlined method for enrolling mobile devices into an MDM environments.

The process:

- **Scan** : The user points the device camera at a unique QR code provided by IT.

- **Decode** : The device reads the embedded URL and enrollment token.
- **Connect** : Safari automatically opens to the specific enrollment portal.
- **Install** : The user is prompted to download and install the MDM profile immediately.

This reduces typing errors and significantly speeds up "User-Initiated Enrollment" (UIE).

## Analogy

Think of this as **"Scan-to-Check-In."** Instead of requiring a student to manually type a long, complicated web address like `https://enroll.myschool.edu/manage/enroll` into Safari, they just open the Camera and scan a square code.

All the setup information is automatically filled in, allowing the iPad to start its first day of school instantly without any typing mistakes.
