## Term Definition

**Zero Trust** is a modern security architecture based on the principle: **"Never Trusted, Always Verified."** Key concepts:

- **No Perimeter** : Being "inside the school building" does not automatically grant access.

- **Continuous Auth** : Every request (opening a file, accessing email) is checked.
- **Context** : Access depends on*Who*you are (User ID),*What*device you have (Managed?), and*Where* you are.
- **Risk Assessment** : If a device is outdated or infected, access is blocked immediately, even if the password is correct.

## Analogy

Think of this as the **"Strict Security Guard"** mode.

In the past, if you were inside the school building, everybody assumed you belonged there.

Under **Zero Trust** , the building is full of **"locked doors."** No matter who you are, the school's system asks to see your **"ID card"** and check your **fingerprints** every single time you want to open a door. It’s strict, but it keeps everyone’s data much safer.
