## Term Definition

**Apple School Manager (ASM)** is the centralized web portal for education administrators to manage people, devices, and content.

It serves as the foundation for modern digital education:

- **Device Assignment** : Linking serial numbers to specific MDM servers for **Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)** .

- **Roster Management** : Syncing with **Student Information Systems (SIS)** to automatically create classes and student accounts.
- **Managed Apple Accounts** : Creating and managing organizational IDs for students and teachers.
- **Content** : Purchasing and distributing educational apps and books in volume.

## Analogy

ASM is the school's **"Digital Registrar's Office."** It's the headquarters where the school registers every iPad, buys every educational app, and creates IDs for every student and teacher.

It makes sure that when a teacher walks into a room, their iPad already **"knows"** exactly which students are in their class, what their names are, and which digital books they need for the lesson.
