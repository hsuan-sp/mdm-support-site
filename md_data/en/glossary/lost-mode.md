## Term Definition

**Lost Mode** is a powerful recovery protocol available for supervised iOS and iPadOS devices.

When activated by IT:

- **Lock Down** : The device is immediately locked and cannot be unlocked by the user.

- **Messaging** : A custom message (e.g., "Property of School - Call 555-0199") is displayed on the Lock Screen.
- **Tracking** : The device begins reporting its GPS coordinates to the MDM server, even if Location Services were previously disabled.
- **Privacy** : Personal data remains encrypted and inaccessible during the lock state.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Remote Digital Handcuff."** If a student leaves their iPad on a bus, IT can press a button to instantly freeze it. The screen will display a "Return to..." message, and the iPad will start shouting its location to the school's map.

It renders the device completely useless to a thief while helping the school get it back safely.
