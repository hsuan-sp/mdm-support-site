## Term Definition

**Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** is a deployment model where students or staff use their personal hardware to access institutional resources.

Apple’s **User Enrollment** framework facilitates BYOD by:

- **Work Partitioning** : Creating a separate, encrypted file system for work data.

- **Privacy Focus** : Institutional management is limited to the work partition.
- **Separation** : The organization has **no access** to personal photos, messages, location data, or apps on the rest of the device.

This achieves a critical balance between maintaining institutional security and protecting personal user privacy.

## Analogy

This is a **"Church and State"** style of management.

Imagine you have your own house (your personal phone). You agree to set aside one specialized, locked **"Office Desk"** (Work Partition) for your school work.

The school can organize or collect papers from that desk at any time, but they have no right—and no way—to peek into your personal drawers or closets.
