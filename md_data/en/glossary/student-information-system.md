## Term Definition

A **Student Information System (SIS)** is the authoritative database used by schools to manage student data.

Key functions:

- **Records** : Stores attendance, grades, medical info, and family contacts.

- **Integration** : Syncs with **Apple School Manager (ASM)** to provide accurate, up-to-date rosters for Managed Apple Accounts.
- **Automation** : When a new student is entered into the SIS, their digital identity and class assignments are automatically created in the school's technology systems.

## Analogy

This is the **"Digital Brain of the School Office."** It's the central hub that knows every student's name, which class they are in, and who their parents are.

By connecting this **"Brain"** to the school's iPad system, everything stays synchronized. If a new student joins the school, the system automatically gives them an iPad account and puts them in the correct classes without any extra paperwork.
