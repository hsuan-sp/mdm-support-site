## Term Definition

**Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP)** is a standard allowing devices to request and retrieve digital certificates automatically.

The workflow:

1. **Request** : The MDM pushes a "SCEP Profile" to the device.

2. **Generation** : The device generates a private key and sends a request to the server.

3. **Issuance** : The Certificate Authority (CA) verifies the request and issues a signed certificate.

4. **Access** : The device presents this certificate to the school's Wi-Fi network to prove, "I am a managed, trusted device."

This automation is critical for zero-touch deployments, removing the need for manual password entry.

## Analogy

Think of this as an **"Automatic ID Booth."** Instead of every single student having to go to the office and wait in line to get their ID badge printed, the MDM sends them a digital **"Voucher."** The student's iPad takes that voucher to a machine (the CA), and the machine prints out their official ID card instantly. It allows the iPad to get its own **"Hall Pass"** for the school Wi-Fi without you lifting a finger.
