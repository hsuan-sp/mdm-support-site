## Term Definition

**Managed Open In** is a foundational Data Loss Prevention (DLP) for iOS and iPadOS.

Functionality:

- **Separation** : It creates a virtual wall between "Managed Apps" (installed by the school) and "Unmanaged Apps" (installed by the user).

- **Restriction** : Administrators can prevent school documents (e.g., from Managed Mail) from being opened in personal apps (e.g., WhatsApp or personal Dropbox).
- **Flow Control** : Conversely, it can also prevent personal data from entering corporate apps to maintain a sterile work environment.

## Analogy

This is the school's **"Data Boundary Rule."** It's like saying, "You can use these confidential school documents on the school’s official desks ( **Managed Apps** ), but you are strictly forbidden from taking those documents over to the coffee shop across the street ( **Personal Apps** )."

It ensures that sensitive school secrets and student grades stay safely inside the school's "fenced" digital garden.
