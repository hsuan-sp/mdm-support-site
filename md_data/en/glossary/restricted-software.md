## Term Definition

**Restricted Software** is a blocking mechanism in Jamf Pro used to prohibit specific applications from running.

Capabilities:

- **Detection** : Monitors the system for the launch of a specific process name (e.g., `Steam.app` or `Install macOS Beta.app`).

- **Kill Process** : The moment the user tries to open the app, the system immediately forces it to quit.
- **Remediation** : Can be configured to delete the application entirely and display a warning message explaining why it is not allowed.

## Analogy

Think of this as the school's **"Digital Hall Monitor."** The hall monitor is always watching. If they see you trying to pull a "prohibited item" (like a video game console) out of your backpack, they immediately **take it away** and give you a warning note.

It helps keep the classroom focused on learning by ensuring distractions (unapproved games) don't even have a chance to start.
