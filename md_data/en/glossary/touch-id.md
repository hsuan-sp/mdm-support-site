## Term Definition

**Touch ID** is Apple's biometric fingerprint identity sensor.

Usage in education:

- **Unlock** : Teachers and older students can unlock iPads without typing a passcode.

- **Purchase** : Authorize App Store requests (if allowed).
- **Security** : MDM settings can mandate that Touch ID is*allowed* to unlock the device but require the passcode after a restart (Biometric Unlock).
- **Constraint** : On Shared iPads, Touch ID is generally disabled because the sensor cannot store fingerprints for 30 different students.

## Analogy

Think of this as your **"Fingerprint Key."** Instead of having to type in a 6-digit code every time you want to use your iPad, you just rest your finger on the button.

The machine recognizes your unique print and lets you in instantly. It’s faster than a key and much harder for someone to steal (unless they steal your finger!).
