## Term Definition

An **IP Address** (Internet Protocol Address) is a unique numerical label assigned to every device connected to a computer network.

It serves two primary functions:

- **Identification** : uniquely identifying a specific host or network interface.

- **Addressing** : Providing the location of the host in the network so data reaches the correct destination.

## Common Types:

- **Dynamic IP (DHCP)** : Automatically and temporarily assigned by a server; the address may change over time.
- **Static IP** : Manually and permanently assigned; the address remains constant.
- **Private IP** : Used within the school's internal network (e.g., `10.x.x.x` or `192.168.x.x`).
- **Public IP** : The address seen by the rest of the world on the internet.

## Analogy

Think of this as your device's **"Digital Street Address."** Just like a mail carrier needs a physical address to deliver a letter to your house, the internet needs an **IP address** to send data to your specific iPad.

Some addresses are owned forever ( **Static** ), while others are like a hotel room number ( **Dynamic** )—you use it while you're checked in, but it might be given to someone else after you "check out" and leave the network.
