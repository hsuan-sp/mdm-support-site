## Term Definition

A **Web Clip** is a configuration profile payload that places a website shortcut on an iOS or iPadOS Home Screen.

Features:

- **Appearance** : Looks exactly like a regular app icon.

- **Function** : When tapped, it launches Safari (or a dedicated full-screen web view) directly to a specified URL.
- **Customization** : IT can define the icon image, the display name, and whether the clip is removable by the user.
- **Use Case** : Commonly used for quick access to school portals, library catalogs, or IT help desks.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Smart Bookmark."** Instead of having to open a browser and type in a long address for the school's learning website, IT places a special **Button** on your iPad that looks just like an app.

You tap it, and it **teleports** you straight to the correct website instantly. It’s a great time-saver for students.
