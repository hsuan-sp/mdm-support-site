## Term Definition

**Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME)** is a standard protocol for automating the management of digital certificates.

It allows devices to automatically:

- **Request** : Ask for a new identity certificate.

- **Verify** : Prove the device's identity to the Certificate Authority (CA).
- **Renew** : Refresh expiring certificates without manual IT intervention.

In modern Apple management, ACME is increasingly replacing the older **SCEP** protocol to ensure that device identity certificates remain valid and secure indefinitely.

## Analogy

ACME is an **"Auto-Renewal Status"** for your security certificates.

Think of it like a digital ID card that expires every few months. Instead of you having to fill out a paper form to renew it, the system automatically handles the paperwork and issues you a new ID in the background.

You never lose access to the network because a certificate "expired" while you weren't looking.
