## Term Definition

A **Custom B2B App** is a specialized application developed specifically for an organization and distributed privately.

Distribution through the **Volume Purchase Program (VPP)** includes:

- **Private Access** : These apps are not visible on the public App Store.

- **Organization Specific** : They are only accessible to specific organizations (identified by Apple Business Manager IDs).
- **Security** : Allows for the deployment of internal tools containing sensitive proprietary logic or curriculum without exposing them to the general public.

## Analogy

This is a **"Private Software Tool"** just for your school or company.

Think of it like a **"Secret Menu"** at a restaurant—regular customers can't see it, and it's not listed on the main board. Only authorized members can see and order (install) these items through the organization's private system.
