## Term Definition

**AirPrint** is Apple’s driverless printing technology. It allows Apple devices to print directly to supported printers on the same local network.

Key advantages for IT:

- **No Drivers** : Eliminates the need for manual driver installation on individual devices.

- **Payloads** : MDM can use an AirPrint payload to push an **"Allowlist"** of specific school printers to student and staff devices.
- **Automation** : Printers appear automatically in the print menu when the device connects to the school network.

## Analogy

Think of this as **"Driver-Free Printing."** In the old days, you had to download and install complicated software for every new printer. With AirPrint, your iPad **"sees"** the printer instantly.

IT sets it up so that as soon as you connect to the school Wi-Fi, all the authorized school printers just show up in your menu, ready to go.
