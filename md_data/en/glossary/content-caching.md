## Term Definition

**Content Caching** is a built-in macOS service that optimizes the delivery of Apple software by storing data locally on the school's network.

How it works:

1. **Initial Download** : When the first device on a network downloads a new OS update or app, the "Caching Mac" saves a copy.

2. **Local Delivery** : When subsequent devices request that same content, they pull it directly from the local Mac at LAN speeds.

3. **Efficiency** : Dramatically reduces external internet usage and speeds up fleet-wide deployments.

## Analogy

Think of this as the school's **"Shared Resource Library."** Instead of every individual student having to travel all the way to the main city library (Apple's servers in the US) to get the same textbook (an update), one person goes to get it and leaves a copy at the school’s front desk.

Now, every other student can just grab a copy from the desk, saving everyone a long trip and keeping the main city roads (the internet) clear.
