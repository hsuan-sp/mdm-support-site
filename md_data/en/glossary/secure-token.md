## Term Definition

A **Secure Token** is a macOS cryptographic attribute that grants a user account the authority to perform critical security operations.

Key functions:

- **FileVault** : Only users with a Secure Token can enable encryption or unlock the disk at boot.

- **Chain of Custody** : The first user created on a Mac (often via automated setup) gets the first token. That user must then "grant" tokens to subsequent users.
- **MDM Escrow** : In a managed environment, the MDM uses a **Bootstrap Token** to automatically grant Secure Tokens to mobile accounts, preventing students from being locked out of encryption management.

## Analogy

Think of this as an **"Authorization Stamp"** for the computer’s bank vault.

Even if you have the key (your login password), the bank guard won't let you open the **Main Vault** (the encrypted hard drive) unless your ID card has the official **"Manager's Stamp"** (Secure Token) on it.

It’s an extra layer of protection to make sure only authorized people can touch the computer's most sensitive security locks.
