## Term Definition

**Software Update** is the system mechanism for downloading and installing new versions of the operating system (macOS/iOS) and its built-in apps (Safari).

Management controls (via DDM):

- **Deferral** : IT can hide an update for up to 90 days to allow for testing.

- **Enforcement** : IT can force an update to install by a specific date and time.
- **Verification** : The device must reach out to Apple's servers to cryptographically verify the update package before installing.

## Analogy

Think of this as **"Device Schooling."** Every once in a while, your device needs to **"go back to class"** to learn new skills (new features) or get stronger (security fixes).

IT is the **Teacher** who decides when it’s the best time for all school iPads to learn these new things, making sure they are ready for the next lesson without surprising you in the middle of an exam.
