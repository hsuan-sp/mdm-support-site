## Term Definition

**System Integrity Protection (SIP)** is a kernel-level security feature in macOS that protects operating system files from modification.

Protection scope:

- **Restricted Areas** : `/System`, `/usr`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, and pre-installed apps.

- **Rootless** : Even the "root" (superuser) account cannot modify these protected locations.
- **Defense** : Prevents malware from injecting code into system processes or modifying critical system binaries to gain persistence.

Disabling SIP generally requires booting into Recovery Mode, a step often taken by developers but strictly prohibited on managed enterprise devices.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Bulletproof Glass Shield"** for the computer’s heart.

Even if you are the owner of the house (the administrator) and you are holding a hammer, the system puts its most important "brain parts" behind this unbreakable glass where no one can touch them.

This makes it almost impossible for a virus or even an accidental mistake to **"break"** the core parts of your Mac.
