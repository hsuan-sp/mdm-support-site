## Term Definition

The **App Store** is Apple’s official platform for downloading and updating applications.

In managed school environments:

- **Restriction** : On supervised devices, IT administrators often use MDM to hide the App Store icon.

- **Focus** : This prevents students from downloading unapproved games or distracting applications.
- **Alternative** : Students are instead directed to use a curated **Self Service** portal to install approved educational tools.

## Analogy

This is Apple’s **"Official Software Mall."** To keep students focused and prevent the installation of unauthorized games, schools often choose to "Board up the mall doors" (hide the App Store icon). Students then go to the **"School Supply Room"** (the Self Service app) to get the specific tools their teachers have approved for the lesson.
