## Term Definition

**Bonjour** is Apple’s implementation of **Zero Configuration Networking (zeroconf)** . It enables devices to discover services on a local network without manual setup.

Common use cases in schools:

- **Printing** : Discovering **AirPrint** enabled printers.

- **Display** : Finding **AirPlay** destinations like Apple TVs.
- **Collaboration** : Allowing **Apple Classroom** to discover student iPads.

Bonjour eliminates the need for users to know technical details like IP addresses or DNS records to connect nearby devices.

## Analogy

Think of this as the **"Automatic Handshake"** system for your devices.

It's like a new student walking into a classroom and announcing "I'm here, and I'm ready to learn!" Everyone else in the room (the other devices) immediately knows they are there and what they can do.

Without Bonjour, you would have to know every device's exact **"GPS Coordinates"** (IP Address) just to say hello to them.
