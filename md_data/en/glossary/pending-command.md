## Term Definition

A **Pending Command** is an administrative instruction sent by the MDM server that has not yet been executed by the target device.

Common causes for pending status:

- **Offline** : The device is turned off or has no internet connection.

- **Sleep** : The device is in a low-power sleep mode and hasn't received the APNs "wakeup" push yet.
- **Busy** : The device is currently processing other commands (a queue backlog).
- **Locked** : Some commands (like OS updates) cannot run if the device is passcode-locked.

The command remains in the queue and will automatically execute the moment the device checks in again.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Letter Waiting in the Mailbox."** The school's main computer (the MDM) has already "mailed" the task to your iPad. However, if your iPad is turned off or unconnected, it can't "open the mail" yet.

As soon as you turn your iPad on and connect to Wi-Fi, it **"checks the mail"** and does whatever work (installing apps, locking screen) is waiting for it.
