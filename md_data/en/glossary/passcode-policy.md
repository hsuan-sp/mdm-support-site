## Term Definition

A **Passcode Policy** is an MDM payload that defines the mandatory password requirements for a managed device.

Configurable rules:

- **Complexity** : Determine if the code can be simple logic (4 digits) or must be complex (alphanumeric).

- **History** : Prevent users from reusing old passwords (e.g., "Cannot use previous 5 passwords").
- **Age** : Force users to change their password every X days (e.g., 90 days).
- **Attempts** : Set the maximum number of failed attempts before the device is automatically wiped (e.g., 10 attempts).

## Analogy

A Passcode Policy is like **"Setting the Standards for Classroom Keys."** Instead of letting students use a cheap, simple lock that anyone can guess (like "1234"), the school creates a rule saying every lock must be a **"Heavy Duty 6-Pin Lock."** This ensures that if a student forgets their iPad on the bus, the thief can't just guess the code, keeping the important school records inside locked up tight.
