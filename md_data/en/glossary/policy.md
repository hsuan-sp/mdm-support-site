## Term Definition

In **Jamf Pro** , a **Policy** is the primary mechanism for executing management tasks on macOS computers.

A Policy consists of:

- **Payload** : What to do (e.g., install Adobe Photoshop, run a script, dock settings).

- **Trigger** : When to do it (e.g., at Startup, at Login, or on a recurring check-in schedule).
- **Scope** : Who to do it to (e.g., "All Staff Macs" but excluding "Student Macs").
- **Frequency** : How often to do it (e.g., "Once per computer" or "Once every week").

## Analogy

A Policy is like a **"School Bell Schedule"** combined with a **"Lesson Plan."** You don't have to announce "Go to Math Class" to every student individually. The bell ( **Trigger** ) automatically signals to the students ( **Scope** ) that it is time to do a specific task ( **Payload** ).

Similarly, a policy tells the computer: _"Every time you wake up (Trigger), check if the printer is installed (Payload)."_
