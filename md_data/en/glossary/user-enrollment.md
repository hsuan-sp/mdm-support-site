## Definition

User Enrollment is a specialized MDM onboarding mode designed specifically for **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** programs. It creates a dedicated "managed volume" for school data (such as school email and managed apps) that is completely separate from the user’s personal data. The school’s IT department has NO access to the user’s personal photos, messages, or apps, and the user can unenroll their device at any time to remove all school data instantly.

## Plain English

This is the "Church and State" of device management. It’s like having a secure "School Locker" inside your personal phone. The school can see and manage what’s inside the locker (your school work and email), but it’s completely impossible for them to see what’s in the rest of your phone. Your private photos and games stay 100% private, and the school can't even "remote wipe" your personal device.
