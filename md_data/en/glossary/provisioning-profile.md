## Term Definition

A **Provisioning Profile** is a digital signing asset that links a developer's certificate, an App ID, and a device (or list of devices) to authorize an app to run.

Usage contexts:

- **App Store Apps** : Signed by Apple, valid indefinitely for the user.

- **In-House Enterprise Apps** : Signed by the organization. These profiles typically expire after **1 year** .
- **Expiration** : If the profile expires, the app will crash immediately upon launch. It must be renewed and pushed via MDM to restore functionality.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Temporary Work Visa"** for apps.

Most apps get a "Permanent Citizenship" from the public App Store. However, if the school creates its own private app just for students, that app only gets a **"1-Year Visa"** (the Provisioning Profile).

If the school forgets to renew the visa, the app gets **"deported"** (stops working) and won't open anymore until it gets its new paperwork stamped.
