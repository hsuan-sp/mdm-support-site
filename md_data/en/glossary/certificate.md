## Term Definition

A digital **Certificate** is an electronic document used to verify a device's identity and enable encrypted communication.

In an MDM environment, certificates are used for:

- **Authentication** : Proving that a device is an authorized member of the organization.

- **TLS/SSL Encryption** : Establishing secure connections between devices and servers.
- **App Signing** : Verifying that an application comes from a trusted source and hasn't been modified.

**Maintenance Note** : If a certificate expires, the device will lose its ability to connect to Wi-Fi or communicate with the management server, requiring a renewal.

## Analogy

This is the **"Digital Identity Card"** for your device.

Just as you need a physical ID to open a bank account, your iPad uses this certificate to prove to the school’s network that it is an official, approved school device.

As long as the ID is valid and hasn't "expired," the network trusts the device and allows it to connect securely.
