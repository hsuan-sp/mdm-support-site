## Definition

A Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) is a logical subnetwork within a physical network. Schools often use VLANs to separate different types of traffic—such as "Academic Network," "Administrative Network," and "Guest Wi-Fi"—onto their own isolated channels. This prevents "broadcast noise" from slowing down the network and ensures that guests cannot access sensitive school servers.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Invisible Walls" inside your network cable. Even though everyone is using the same physical "Internet Pipe," the VLANs act like dividers that slice the pipe into several smaller, private tunnels. Water in Tunnel A (the guest Wi-Fi) can never leak into Tunnel B (the school's private exam server), keeping everything organized and secure.
