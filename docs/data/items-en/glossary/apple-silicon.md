# Term Definition
Apple Silicon refers to the custom-designed chips (like the M1, M2, M3, and M4 series) used in modern Macs and iPads. These chips integrate the CPU, GPU, and memory, providing industry-leading performance and battery life for classroom tasks.

# Analogy
Apple Silicon is like the **"Custom Engine"** in a high-performance school bus. It’s designed specifically by the same people who built the bus (the software), so it’s incredibly efficient. It allows students to work on heavy video projects or complex simulations all day without needing to stay plugged into a wall outlet.
