## Definition

WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 are the standard security protocols used to encrypt Wi-Fi connections. WPA3 is the latest and most secure standard, designed to better protect users from modern hacking techniques. Institutional networks, such as those at TES, typically use **WPA2 or WPA3 Enterprise**, which requires individual user authentication or device certificates rather than a shared "home-style" password, providing a much higher level of security for the school community.

## Plain English

Think of these as the "Different Levels of Locks" on your school's front door. WPA1 was like an old, simple latch (too easy to break). WPA2 is like a strong deadbolt lock that most houses and schools use today. WPA3 is the newest "Smart Lock" that is even harder for a thief to trick. The school uses these high-level locks to make sure only students and teachers can get onto the school Wi-Fi, keeping everyone's data safe.
