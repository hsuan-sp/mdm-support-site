## Definition

Managed Classes are pedagogical groups created within an MDM (such as Jamf School) or Apple School Manager (ASM). A class record includes student enrollments, assigned teachers, class schedules, and a list of required apps. This information is automatically synchronized to the Apple **Classroom** app, allowing teachers to instantly monitor and manage the school-issued iPads of every student in that specific class.

## Plain English

Think of this as your "Digital Class Register." When a teacher opens the Apple Classroom app, the system has already organized everything: the names of the students for that specific lesson and their iPad details are all ready to go. The teacher can instantly have the whole class open a textbook or check if anyone is playing a game, without having to manually check serial numbers or names.
