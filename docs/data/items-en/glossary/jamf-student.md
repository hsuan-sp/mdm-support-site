## Definition

Jamf Student is a companion application installed on student iPads that communicates with the **Jamf Teacher** app. It allows students to view classroom materials, submit assignments, and request assistance from their teacher. Commands sent by the teacher (such as "lock to app" or "open website") are received and executed through this portal, facilitating a controlled digital learning environment.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Learner's Portal" on the iPad. It's the app that listens for the teacher's instructions. When a teacher wants everyone to look at the same webpage, they send the link to this app, and the iPad automatically opens it for the student. It helps keep everyone synchronized during a lesson.
