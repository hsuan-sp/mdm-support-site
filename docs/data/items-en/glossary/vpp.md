## Term Definition

**VPP (Volume Purchase Program)** is the Apple licensing framework for bulk app and book distribution.

Mechanics:

* **Ownership**: The organization buys the licenses (e.g., 500 copies of Procreate), not the user.

* **Distribution**: Licenses are assigned to devices or Apple IDs via MDM ("Managed Distribution").

* **Revocation**: If a student leaves or graduates, the school can **revoke** the license and reclaim it to the central pool, ready to be assigned to a new incoming student.

* **Cost**: Eliminates the need to repurchase software every year.

## Analogy

Think of this as the school's **"Digital Library."**

Instead of every student having to use their own money to buy a textbook, the school buys 500 copies. The school **"lends"** a copy to each student.

When the school year is over, the school **"takes the book back"** electronically and puts it back on the shelf, ready for the next class to use.
