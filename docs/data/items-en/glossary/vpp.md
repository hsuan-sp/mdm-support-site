## Term Definition

The Volume Purchase Program (VPP) allows schools to purchase App Store content in bulk. These licenses belong to the school and can be distributed over-the-air to any managed device without requiring a personal Apple ID.

## Analogy

VPP is like the **"School’s Digital Resource Center."** Instead of asking students to buy their own textbooks or graphing calculators, the school buys 100 copies of a curriculum app. The school then "loans" these digital licenses to students via the MDM. When the school year ends, the school can "reclaim" the license and lend it to next year's students.
