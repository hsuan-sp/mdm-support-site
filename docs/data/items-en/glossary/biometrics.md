## Term Definition

Face ID and Touch ID are biometric authentication technologies. They allow students and staff to securely unlock their devices or authorize app installations using their face or fingerprint, tied to the Secure Enclave on the chip.

## Analogy

Biometrics are like **"Personal Campus ID Badges."** Instead of typing in a long code every time a student needs to open their device, they just show their face or press their thumb. It’s a very secure way to ensure that only the correct person—and no one else—is accessing the school’s sensitive documents.
