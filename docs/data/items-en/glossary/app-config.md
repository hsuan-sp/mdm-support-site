## Term Definition

**App Configuration** (Managed App Config) allows MDM to inject specific settings directly into an application during its deployment.

The benefits include:

* **Zero-Touch Setup**: Server URLs, license keys, and usernames are pre-filled.

* **Security**: Specific features within the app can be locked or hidden.

* **Consistency**: All students receive the exact same app configuration automatically.

This eliminates the need for manual setup by students or teachers and significantly reduces configuration errors.

## Analogy

Think of this as an app that comes **"Pre-filled."**

When IT sends you an email app, the server settings and your email address are already typed in for you. All you have to do is open the app and start working. You don't need to call IT to ask for complicated IP addresses or secret port numbers.
