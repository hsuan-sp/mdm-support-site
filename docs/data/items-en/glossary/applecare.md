## Term Definition

AppleCare is Apple's specialized service and support plan. For schools, AppleCare for Enterprise or Education provides accidental damage protection, on-site service, and technical support for IT teams.

## Analogy

AppleCare is like the **"Campus Maintenance Warranty."** If a student accidentally drops their iPad during a science field trip or a teacher spills coffee on their Mac, the school doesn't have to pay for a full replacement. It’s a safety net that ensures the school’s technology assets are quickly repaired and returned to the classroom.
