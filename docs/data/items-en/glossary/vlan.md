## Term Definition

A Virtual LAN (VLAN) is a networking technique that segments a physical campus network into smaller, logical groups. This is often used to isolate student devices from teacher devices or administrative servers for security and performance reasons.

## Analogy

A VLAN is like having **"Separate Hallways"** in the school building. Even though everyone is in the same building (the network), students walk down one hallway and teachers walk down another. This prevents groups from bumping into each other and ensures that students don't accidentally wander into the staff room where private records are kept.
