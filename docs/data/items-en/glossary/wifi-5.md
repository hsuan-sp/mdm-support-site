## Term Definition

**Wi-Fi 5** (IEEE 802.11ac) is an older wireless standard introduced in 2014, operating exclusively in the 5 GHz frequency band.

Key characteristics:

* **Speed**: significantly faster than Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n), allowing for HD video streaming.

* **MU-MIMO**: Introduced the ability for routers to talk to multiple devices simultaneously (Wave 2), though less efficiently than Wi-Fi 6.

* **Legacy Status**: While still functional, it struggles in high-density environments like modern classrooms where every student has a device.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Wide Highway."**

Before Wi-Fi 5 (Wi-Fi 4), we drove on narrow country roads (2.4 GHz). Wi-Fi 5 built a **wide, fast highway** (5 GHz) that allowed cars to drive much faster.

However, as more cars (Ipads) joined the road, the highway started to get congested because the traffic lights (router) weren't smart enough to manage the flow efficiently.
