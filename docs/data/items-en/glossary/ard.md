## Term Definition

**Apple Remote Desktop (ARD)** is a powerful desktop management application for macOS designed for local network administration.

While MDM handles broad, persistent settings, ARD is optimized for **real-time tasks**:

* **Screen Monitoring**: View multiple Mac screens simultaneously in a classroom or lab.

* **Remote Assistance**: Take control of a user's keyboard and mouse to provide technical support.

* **Software Distribution**: Rapidly push large packages or files directly to a group of student laptops.

* **Execution**: Run remote shell scripts on a selection of target Macs.

## Analogy

Think of this as the **"Immediate Control Console"** for IT.

If MDM is like posting school rules on a bulletin board for everyone to read, ARD is like a teacher standing in the room and helping you personally. IT can see your screen, move your mouse to show you a fix, or **"broadcast"** a file to every Mac in the room instantly.
