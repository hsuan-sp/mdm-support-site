## Term Definition

Apple Classroom is a tool for teachers to manage student iPads in the classroom. It allows teachers to launch apps on every student's device simultaneously, view student screens in real-time, and lock devices into a single app to keep everyone focused on the lesson.

## Analogy

Apple Classroom is the teacher's **"Instructional Dashboard."** It’s like having a magic button that ensures every student opens their textbook to page 42 at the exact same moment. If a student gets distracted, the teacher can "peek" at their screen or gently lock them into the current activity to keep the lesson moving smoothly.
