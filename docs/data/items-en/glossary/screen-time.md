## Term Definition

Screen Time provides insights into device usage and allows for the setting of limits on specific apps or websites. For school-owned devices, MDM can manage these settings to ensure students remain focused during school hours.

## Analogy

Screen Time is like a **"Classroom Concentration Assistant."** It helps students understand how they are spending their digital time. If the school wants to ensure students aren't distracted by social media during lunch or games after bedtime, the school can set "Quiet Hours" to help promote a healthy digital-life balance.
