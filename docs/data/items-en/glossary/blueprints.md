## Definition

Blueprints are an advanced automation framework within Jamf management tools. They allow administrators to define a "Desired State" for a device and continuously monitor for compliance. If a device drifts from this standard (e.g., an app is deleted or a setting is changed), the Blueprint automatically triggers a corrective action. This proactive self-healing mechanism is more intelligent than traditional policies and ensures devices remain compliant with the organization's security baseline.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Autopilot Mode" for computer management. You set the destination (e.g., "Must have antivirus and disk encryption"), and the system automatically keeps the device on track. If the device "veers off course," the Blueprint pulls it back into alignment without IT needing to manually intervene.
