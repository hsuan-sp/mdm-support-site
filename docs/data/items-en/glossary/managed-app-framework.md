## Term Definition

The**Managed App Framework**(announced at WWDC 2025) is the modern successor to the legacy "Managed App Configuration" standard.

Capabilities:

* **Dynamic Updates**: Allows apps to receive configuration changes (settings, server URLs) in real-time without needing a restart.
* **Secure Channel**: Establishes a direct, encrypted pipeline between the MDM and the app for delivering sensitive items like identity certificates.
* **Pull Model**: Apps can proactively request updated settings from the system, rather than waiting passively for a push.

## Analogy

In the past, giving an app its settings was like**"Leaving a note in a mailbox"**—the app could only read the note when it first opened.

The new**Managed App Framework**is more like**"Instant Messaging."**

The app can talk to the school system *while* you are using it to get the latest security updates or server changes instantly. It’s faster, safer, and means your apps are always set up perfectly without you having to restart them.
