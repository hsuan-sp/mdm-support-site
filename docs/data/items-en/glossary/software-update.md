## Definition

Software Update refers to the process of installing both major upgrades (new versions like macOS 16) and minor updates (security fixes) to an Apple operating system. Using **Declarative Device Management (DDM)**, school administrators can schedule these updates for specific times, force them to install after a certain deadline, or defer them to ensure that all educational software remains compatible before the entire school moves to a new version.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Device Schooling." Every once in a while, your device needs to "go back to class" to learn new skills (new features) or get "stronger" (security fixes). IT is the teacher who decides when it’s the best time for all school iPads to learn these new things, making sure they are ready for the next lesson without any surprises.
