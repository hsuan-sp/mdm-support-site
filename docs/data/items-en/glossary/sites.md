## Term Definition

**Sites** is a multi-tenancy architecture feature within Jamf Pro.

Functionality:

* **Segmentation**: Allows a single MDM server to be virtually divided into distinct administrative zones.

* **Granular Access**: "Site Administrators" can only see and manage devices, users, and policies that belong to their specific site.

* **Independence**: Actions taken in "High School Site" do not affect devices in "Primary School Site."

This is essential for large districts or university systems where different departments need autonomy but share a central infrastructure.

## Analogy

Think of this as **"Separate Private Offices in a Shared Building."**

The school district might own the whole building (the server), but inside, there are locked private offices (Sites) for each individual school.

The Primary School staff can't see the High School’s iPads, and each school can set their own rules without interfering with the other.
