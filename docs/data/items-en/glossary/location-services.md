## Definition

Location Services allow Apple devices to determine their approximate geographical location using a combination of GPS, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi hotspots, and cellular towers. School administrators can mandate that this feature remains active to ensure that if an iPad is reported lost or stolen, IT can use **Lost Mode** to see its location on a map and assist in its recovery.

## Plain English

Think of this as your device's "Digital Map and Radar." When it's on, your iPad always knows where it is in the world. For the school, this is like having a "Safety Tracker." If you lose your iPad in a park or forget it in a classroom, the IT team can look at a map to see exactly where it is so they can go pick it up and return it to you.
