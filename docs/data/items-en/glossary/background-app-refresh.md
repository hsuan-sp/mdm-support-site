## Term Definition

**Background App Refresh** allows applications to periodically fetch new content and updates even while the device is in standby or the app is not actively in use.

Management through MDM:

* **Productivity**: Mail apps fetch new messages, and News apps pre-load headlines.

* **Battery Optimization**: MDM can disable this feature globally or for specific apps to extend the battery life of student devices.

* **Bandwidth**: Controlling background activity can help manage network congestion during the school day.

## Analogy

Think of this as the app's **"Standby Concierge."**

While you aren't using the device, your apps are "tidying up" and "collecting mail" in the background so everything is ready the moment you unlock the iPad.

If the concierge is working too hard and draining the battery, IT can tell them to rest (disable the feature) so the iPad stays powered through the last period.
