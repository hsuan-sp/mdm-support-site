## Definition

1.1X is an IEEE standard for port-based Network Access Control (PNAC). It provides an authentication mechanism to devices wishing to attach to a LAN or WLAN. In enterprise and school environments (such as eduroam), 802.1X requires devices to provide valid digital certificates or credentials, which are verified by a RADIUS server before granting network access. This is significantly more secure than a shared Wi-Fi password, as it prevents unauthorized devices from entering the internal network.

## Plain English

Think of 802.1X as an "Airport Security Checkpoint" for your network. Standard home Wi-Fi is like a house key—anyone who has the key can walk in. 802.1X requires everyone to show their own passport (certificate) and ticket (credentials). If the identity doesn't match the list, they aren't allowed through the gate.
