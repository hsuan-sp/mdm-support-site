## Definition

Bonjour is Apple’s implementation of Zero Configuration Networking (zeroconf). It allows Apple devices to automatically discover printers (AirPrint), displays (AirPlay), and other management devices (Apple Classroom) on the same local network without requiring manual configuration of IP addresses or DNS.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Automatic Handshake" system for your devices. It's like a new student walking into a classroom and announcing "I'm here, and I can draw!" Everyone else (the other devices) immediately knows they are there and what service they provide. Without Bonjour, you would have to know every device's exact "Street Address" (IP Address) just to talk to them.
