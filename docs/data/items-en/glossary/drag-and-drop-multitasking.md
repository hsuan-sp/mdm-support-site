## Term Definition

Introduced in **iPadOS 26.2**, this feature enhances the speed and fluidity of multitasking on the iPad.

Workflow improvements:

* **Direct Interaction**: Users can ahora drag app icons directly from the **Dock** or **Spotlight** search results onto the active screen.

* **Dynamic Layouts**: Dragging an icon results in the instant creation of **Split View**, **Slide Over**, or complex multi-window layers.

* **Productivity**: Reduces the number of taps and swipes needed to arrange a workspace for research, writing, or collaboration.

## Analogy

Think of this as **"Organizing your physical desk"** with one hand.

Instead of opening apps one by one, you can just grab a tool from your shelf (the Dock) and drop it right onto the table to start working side-by-side with what's already there. It makes using two or three apps at once feel as natural as moving papers around on a real desk.
