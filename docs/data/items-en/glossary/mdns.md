## Term Definition

**Multicast DNS (mDNS)** is the underlying "zero-configuration" network protocol that powers Apple’s **Bonjour** service.

How it works:

* **Discovery**: Devices use UDP port 5353 to broadcast their availability on the local network.

* **Resolution**: It allows devices to translate local hostnames (like `My-iPad.local`) into IP addresses without a central DNS server.

* **Challenge**: By default, mDNS signals do not cross between different network subnets (VLANs). In large schools, IT creates an **"mDNS Gateway"** or **"Bonjour Reflector"** to allow AirPlay and AirPrint to work across the entire campus.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Local PA System"** for computers.

Devices use this to shout, "I'm a printer in Hallway A!" or "I'm an AirPlay screen in Room 302!" to anyone nearby who is listening.

Because it's a "local shout," the signal usually can't be heard in other buildings or floors unless the school's **"Sound Engineers"** (the network team) set up a special relay system to broadcast the message further.
