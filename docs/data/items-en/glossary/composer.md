## Definition

Composer is a professional software packaging tool provided by Jamf for macOS. IT administrators use it to create system snapshots that monitor file changes during a software installation. These changes are then bundled into a standard `.pkg` or `.dmg` installer, allowing complex software suites to be easily deployed to hundreds of Macs simultaneously via MDM.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Professional Gift Wrapper" for software. If you have a complicated app with many different parts, you use Composer to neatly organize and pack them into a single "Box" (a .pkg file). Once IT sends that box to other computers, the recipients just have to open it, and all the parts automatically go exactly where they belong.
