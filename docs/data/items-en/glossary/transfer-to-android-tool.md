## Term Definition

The **Transfer to Android Tool** is a migration utility introduced in iOS 26.3 to facilitate data portability.

Functionality:

* **Direction**: Moves data *from* an iPhone *to* an Android device.

* **Content**: Transfers contacts, message history, photos, videos, and DRM-free music.

* **MDM Restriction**: Administrators can block this feature on supervised devices to prevent corporate or school data (like contacts) from being exported to unmanaged personal devices.

## Analogy

This is the **"Exit Migration Helper."**

Just as Apple has a tool to help people move *in* (Move to iOS), this tool helps people pack up their boxes and move *out* to a different house (Android).

For schools, it's something to watch out for. You don't want a student packing up the school's "furniture" (school data) and taking it to their personal house where the school keys no longer work.
