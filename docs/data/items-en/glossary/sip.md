## Term Definition

System Integrity Protection (SIP) is a security architecture in macOS that prevents even root-level users from modifying protected parts of the operating system. This ensures the foundational system files remain untampered with.

## Analogy

SIP is like a **"Bulletproof Display Case"** for the school’s most important records. Even if a student or a malicious program gets "Janitor Access" (Root access) to the building, they still can't touch the important documents behind the glass. This keeps the Mac’s "brain" safe from being accidentally or intentionally broken.
