## Term Definition

An **Extension Attribute** is a powerful customization feature in Jamf Pro that allows administrators to collect data points not covered by the standard MDM inventory protocol.

Capabilities:

* **Custom Scripts**: Run Bash, Zsh, or Python scripts to query deep system settings.

* **Specific Monitoring**: Report on unique items like the number of **battery cycles**, the presence of internal company files, or specific hardware daughterboard IDs.

* **Reporting**: The data collected is populated into the device record and can be used to trigger **Smart Groups**.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Custom Survey"** or a **"Specific Health Quiz"** for your computers.

A standard inventory check only asks basic questions like "What is your serial number?". An **Extension Attribute** lets IT ask much more specific and inquisitive questions, like "Did you restart your computer this month?" or "Is your hard drive feeling too full?".

It helps IT find small, hidden problems before they turn into major system failures.
