## Term Definition

An **eSIM** (embedded SIM) is a programmable digital SIM card built directly into the device's hardware, replacing the need for a physical plastic SIM.

In an MDM environment:

* **Remote Provisioning**: IT can push cellular data plans to a fleet of iPads or iPhones over-the-air.

* **Security**: The SIM cannot be physically removed or stolen from the device.

* **Logistics**: Eliminates the cost and delay of shipping physical SIM cards to staff or students.

* **Flexibility**: Devices can store multiple eSIM profiles, making it easy to switch between local and international data plans for school trips.

## Analogy

This is a **"Virtual SIM Card."**

In the past, switching cellular providers meant using a paperclip to poke a tiny hole and swap a plastic chip. With **eSIM**, it's like "downloading" your phone number and data plan through the air, just like an app.

It’s faster, more secure, and you never have to worry about losing a tiny, fragile piece of plastic.
