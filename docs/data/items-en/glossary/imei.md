## Term Definition

The **International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI)** is a unique 15-digit serial number used to identify an individual mobile device on a cellular network.

Key features:

* **Hardcoded**: Unlike a phone number, the IMEI is permanently assigned to the hardware and cannot be easily changed or replaced.

* **Cellular Only**: Exists only on devices with cellular capabilities (iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads).

* **Security**: If a device is lost or stolen, the IMEI can be provided to carriers to **blocklist** the device, preventing it from ever connecting to a mobile network again, even if the SIM card is swapped.

## Analogy

This is the device's **"Engine Number"** or **"Social Security Number."**

While the "Phone Number" can change (like a car's license plate), the **IMEI** is permanently engraved into the machine's "Digital DNA."

If a school iPad goes missing, knowing this number allows the school to tell all cellular companies to "block" this specific machine. Even if a thief tries to put their own SIM card into the iPad, the network will recognize the blocked IMEI and refuse to let the machine go online.
