## Definition

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique 15-digit serial number used to identify an individual mobile device on a cellular network. Every iPad or iPhone with a SIM card slot has a unique IMEI that is hardcoded into the hardware. If a cellular-enabled device is stolen, this number can be used by the school and local authorities to blocklist the device, preventing it from ever connecting to a mobile network again.

## Plain English

This is the device's "Engine Number" or "Social Security Number." While the phone number can change (like a license plate), the IMEI is permanently engraved into the machine's "DNA." If a school iPad goes missing, knowing this number allows the school to tell all cellular companies to "block" this specific machine so no one else can use it to get online.
