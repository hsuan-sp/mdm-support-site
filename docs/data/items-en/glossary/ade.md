# Term Definition
Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) is an Apple service that automatically links a new device to the school's management system the moment it is powered on. Because the device is registered with the school at the point of purchase, it will automatically download its management profile during the initial setup, even if it is erased.

# Analogy
ADE is like an **"Invisible Property Tag"** that is attached to the serial number at the factory. When a student unboxes a new school iPad, they don't need to bring it to IT. As soon as it connects to Wi-Fi, it recognizes that it belongs to the school "membership" and automatically sets itself up, skipping the manual paperwork.
