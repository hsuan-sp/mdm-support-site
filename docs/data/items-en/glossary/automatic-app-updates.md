## Term Definition

**Automatic App Updates** is a background system mechanism that ensures applications are always current.

Functional aspects:

* **Automation**: The device automatically downloads and installs updates when connected to Wi-Fi and in an idle state.

* **MDM Control**: Administrators can force-enable this feature to maintain version consistency across the fleet or disable it to manage bandwidth during critical times.

* **Security**: Ensures that all devices have the latest security patches and features for their installed applications.

## Analogy

Think of this as **"Automatic Maintenance"** for your apps.

Just as a car dealership might automatically change your oil when you bring the car in, the system handles the updates behind the scenes so the apps are always ready to use.

This ensures that students are not exposed to security risks or missing features caused by running outdated, "sputtering" software.
