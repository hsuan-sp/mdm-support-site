## Analogy

This is **"Mind Reading"** for your Apple devices.

It makes all your gadgets act like one big, synchronized team. If you copy a photo on your iPhone, you can immediately **"paste"** it into a project on your Mac. It feels like there’s an invisible thread connecting all your devices, allowing your work to flow smoothly from one screen to the next without losing your place.
