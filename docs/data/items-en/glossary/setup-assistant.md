## Term Definition

The **Setup Assistant** is the initial configuration wizard presented on Apple devices (starting with the "Hello" screen).

MDM customization:

* **Streamlining**: Using **Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)**, organizations can hide unnecessary panes (e.g., Apple Pay, Siri, True Tone).

* **Mandatory Fields**: Can force the user to connect to Wi-Fi and install the management profile before proceeding.

* **Goal**: Reduces the "Time to Desktop" from 20 minutes of questions down to 30 seconds of waiting.

## Analogy

Think of this as the **"Beginner's Tutorial"** for your new device.

Just like a video game asks you to choose your character’s name and settings at the start, the Setup Assistant asks you how you want your iPad to work.

However, the school can choose to **"Skip the Tutorial"** for you. So when you turn the iPad on, it bypasses the boring questions and goes straight to the home screen, all set up and ready for class.
