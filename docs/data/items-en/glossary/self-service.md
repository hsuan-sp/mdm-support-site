## Definition

Self Service is a private "App Store" for the school. IT administrators can publish approved software, helpful links, and troubleshooting scripts here, allowing students and teachers to install what they need without needing administrator passwords.

## Plain English

Self Service is the **"Campus Supply Store."** If a student needs a specific calculator app or a teacher needs a new version of Zoom, they don't have to fill out a request form. They just "walk into the store" (open the app), click install, and the item is delivered to their device immediately—all pre-approved and safe to use.
