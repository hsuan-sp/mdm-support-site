## Term Definition

A **Temporary Session** (often called Guest functionality) is a feature of the **Shared iPad** environment.

Workflow:

* **Login**: User taps "Guest" on the login screen (no username/password needed).

* **Usage**: User has full access to apps and Safari for the duration of the session.

* **Logout**: When the user logs out, the cryptographic keys for that session are destroyed.

* **Wipe**: All data—browsing history, documents, photos, caches—is instantly and permanently erased.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Public Library Computer."**

You don't need a library card to sit down and start using it. However, the moment you stand up and **"log out,"** the keyboard auto-cleans itself and the computer **shreds any papers** you left on the desk.

This ensures the next person can't see what you were doing, and the iPad stays fresh and fast for everyone.
