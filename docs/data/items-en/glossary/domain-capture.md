## Definition

Domain Capture is a security feature within Apple Business Manager (ABM). Once an organization verifies ownership of an email domain (e.g., `@tes.tp.edu.tw`), it can "capture" any personal Apple Accounts that were previously created using that institutional email address. Users are then required to either move their account to a private email or convert it into a "Managed Apple Account" under the organization's control.

## Plain English

Think of this as an "Official Domain Claim." If a teacher or student used their school email to sign up for a personal Apple ID in the past, the school is now saying, "That address belongs to the school." The user must then decide to either keep their personal data by changing the email to a Gmail address or hand the account over to the school to be officially managed.

## MDM Context

This is a critical step for schools wanting to implement Federated Authentication. It ensures that the school has full authority over all accounts associated with its official domain, preventing confusion between personal and professional assets.
