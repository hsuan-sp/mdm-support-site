## Term Definition

**Passkeys** are a next-generation authentication standard developed by Apple and the FIDO Alliance to replace traditional passwords.

Security advantages:

* **Biometric**: Credentials are unlocked using Face ID or Touch ID, ensuring only the physical user can access them.

* **Cryptography**: Based on public-key infrastructure (PKI). A unique key pair is generated for each account; the private key never leaves the user's device.

* **Phishing Resistant**: Because the user does not know a "text string" to type in, they cannot accidentally give their password to a fake website.

* **Recovery**: Passkeys can be synchronized via iCloud Keychain, ensuring they are available across all user devices.

## Analogy

Think of this as **"Replacing your password with your face."**

Instead of having to remember and type a complicated code like "P@ssw0rd123," your device creates a secret, un-copyable **"Digital Key"** just for you.

When you want to log in, you simply look at the camera. It’s faster, impossible to forget, and a hacker can't "guess" it or steal it from you because it doesn't exist as a word you can write down.
