## Definition

Apple Business Manager (ABM) is a web-based portal for IT administrators to deploy Apple devices, purchase apps and books in volume, and manage Managed Apple Accounts. It integrates Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) and the Volume Purchase Program (VPP). An MDM server must be linked to ABM to prove organizational ownership of devices and enable zero-touch deployment.

## Plain English

ABM is the "Central Assets Headquarters" for an organization's Apple devices. Every piece of hardware the company buys and every software license is registered here first. Think of the MDM as a third-party management company that must get a "Central Key" from the Headquarters (ABM) before it is allowed to enter and manage the company's property.
