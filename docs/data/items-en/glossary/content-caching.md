## Term Definition

Content Caching is a macOS service that speeds up the download of Apple-distributed software (like OS updates and apps) by saving copies of those files on a local server. When a second student downloads the same app, it comes from the school’s local network rather than the internet.

## Analogy

Content Caching is like having a **"Campus Library"** instead of ordering every book from overseas. When the first student "orders" a new iPad update, a copy is kept on the school’s shelf. When the next 50 students want that same update, they just get it from the library down the hall, saving the school’s internet "highway" from getting jammed.
