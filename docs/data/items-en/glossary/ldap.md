## Definition

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an open industry-standard protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an IP network. MDM systems use LDAP to "talk" to institutional databases (like Active Directory) to retrieve lists of students, staff, and departments. This allows IT to target specific management policies to the correct group of people automatically.

## Plain English

This is the "Common Language" used to check the school's central directory. Just as two people from different countries might use English to communicate, different computer systems use LDAP to "ask" the central database for information—like "Who is in Grade 5?" or "Does this teacher work in the Science department?".
