## Definition

AirPrint is Apple’s driverless printing technology. It allows devices to print directly to supported printers on the same local network without the need for manual driver installation. MDM can use an AirPrint payload to push an "Allowlist" of school printers directly to users' devices, ensuring that student and staff iPads are ready to print to the nearest school printer automatically.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Driver-Free Printing." In the old days, you had to download and install complicated software for every new printer. With AirPrint, your iPad "sees" the printer instantly. IT can set it up so that as soon as you connect to the school Wi-Fi, all the school’s printers just show up in your print menu, ready to go.
