## Term Definition

**Always-on VPN** is a mandatory network security policy for managed devices that ensures all traffic is tunnelled through a secure gateway.

Key characteristics:

* **Automatic Connection**: When the device detects any network connection (Wi-Fi or Cellular), it immediately establishes an encrypted tunnel to the organizational network.

* **Lockdown Mode**: If the VPN fail to connect, the device can block all network traffic.

* **Privacy & Security**: Ensures that sensitive data is never transmitted over unencrypted public networks.

## Analogy

This is a **"Mandatory Security Tunnel."**

Whether a student is at a cafe or an airport, the system forces all internet usage to go through the school's private, encrypted lane first. If the tunnel isn't available, the internet simply won't work. This ensures that no matter where the device goes, the data stays safe from hackers on public Wi-Fi.
