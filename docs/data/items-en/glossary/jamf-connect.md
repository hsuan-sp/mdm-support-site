## Definition

Jamf Connect is a specialized tool that streamlines the login experience on macOS by integrating cloud identity providers (such as Google Workspace, Microsoft Entra ID, or Okta) directly into the Mac login screen. It ensures that a user's local Mac password stays synchronized with their official school cloud password, significantly reducing "forgotten password" tickets and enabling modern features like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) during the initial computer setup.

## Plain English

This is the "Cloud ID Portal" for your Mac. Instead of having a separate password just for your laptop, Jamf Connect lets you log in using your regular school email and password. It's like having a "Master Key"—if you change your school password online, your Mac password automatically updates to match, so you only ever have to remember one set of login details.
