## Definition

iCloud Private Relay is a privacy service from Apple for iCloud+ subscribers. It encrypts DNS requests and hides your IP address by routing your Safari traffic through two separate internet relays. While this protects your privacy from trackers, it can interfere with school network filters that need to identify devices. For this reason, many school networks and MDMs are configured to block Private Relay to ensure a safe and monitored online environment for students.

## Plain English

Think of this as an "Invisibility Cloak" for whenever you use the internet. It hides who you are (your IP address) and where you are going. However, at school, teachers and the IT team need to make sure you are staying on safe websites. Because the "Invisibility Cloak" stops them from being able to protect you, the school usually asks you to take the cloak off (turns the feature off) while you are using school Wi-Fi.
