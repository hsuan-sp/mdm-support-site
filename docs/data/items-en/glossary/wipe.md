## Term Definition

A **Wipe** (or Remote Wipe) is the MDM command to factory reset a device.

Consequences:

* **Deletion**: Permanently erases all user data, apps, accounts, and settings.

* **Reset**: Returns the operating system to its "out-of-box" state ("Hello" screen).

* **Security**: Used as a last resort for lost/stolen devices to prevent data theft.

* **lifecycle**: Used at the end of a school year to prepare an iPad for a new student.

## Analogy

This is the **"Digital Reset Button."**

When IT sends this command, it tells the iPad to completely **"forget"** everything it knows—every photo, every app, and every setting is erased.

The iPad then wakes up looking exactly as it did the day it was first taken out of its box, clean and ready for a fresh start.
