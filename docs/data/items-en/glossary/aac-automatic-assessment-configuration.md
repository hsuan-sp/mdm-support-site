## Definition

Automatic Assessment Configuration (AAC) is a specialized lock-down mode in iOS and iPadOS designed for high-stakes standardized testing. When a student opens a supported testing app, AAC automatically disables features like the dictionary, spell check, screenshots, screen recording, and all push notifications. Once the test is completed and the student exits the app, the device automatically restores all features without requiring manual IT intervention.

## Plain English

This is the iPad's "Proctored Exam Mode." When the test starts, the system temporarily "confiscates" all potential cheating tools (like copy-paste, Siri, or auto-correct). As soon as the test is over, these tools are automatically returned to the student, ensuring a fair and secure testing environment for everyone.
