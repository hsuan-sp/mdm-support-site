## Definition

Find My is Apple’s device tracking and recovery service. It allows users to locate their devices on a map, play a sound, display a lost message, or remotely erase data. For school-owned hardware, MDM can enable a specialized "Managed Lost Mode" that tracks the device's location and locks the interface without requiring the device to be signed into a personal iCloud account.

## Plain English

This is the device's "Built-in GPS Tracker." If a student leaves their iPad on a bus or at a park, IT can see exactly where it is on a map. They can even make it play a loud "beeping" sound or put a message on the screen saying, "Return to TES Front Office." If the device is gone forever, IT can "Self-Destruct" the data remotely so no one else can see school files.
