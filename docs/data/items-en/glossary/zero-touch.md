# Term Definition
Zero-Touch Deployment is a process where devices are shipped directly to teachers or students and automatically configured over-the-air. IT never has to physically touch the box, as ADE and MDM handle the setup remotely.

# Analogy
Zero-Touch is the **"Unbox and Play"** experience. Imagine buying a new lego set that builds itself the moment you open the lid. For the school, it means a new laptop can be delivered directly to a teacher’s home during the summer; the moment they log in, all their school apps and settings appear magically, without a single trip to the IT office.
