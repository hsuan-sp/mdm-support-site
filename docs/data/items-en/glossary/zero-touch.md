## Term Definition

**Zero-Touch Deployment** is a hands-off distribution model for Apple devices.

Workflow:
1. **Purchase**: School buys devices from Apple/Reseller.
2. **Assign**: Devices are automatically added to **Apple School Manager (ASM)**.
3. **Ship**: Unopened boxes are shipped directly to students' homes.
4. **Setup**: Student opens the box and connects to Wi-Fi.
5. **Enroll**: The device checks in with Apple, sees it belongs to the school, downloads the MDM profile, and installs all apps automatically.

## Analogy

Think of this as **"Instant School iPad Magic."**

The school's IT team doesn't even have to open the box. They can send a brand-new iPad straight to your home.

The moment you turn it on and connect to your home Wi-Fi, the iPad **"realizes"** it belongs to the school and automatically begins setting itself up with your email, textbooks, and apps—all by itself!
