## Definition

A Provisioning Profile is a digital authorization file that allows an app to run on a specific Apple device. For custom, "In-House" apps developed by a school or organization, these profiles must be signed by an official Apple Developer account. These profiles have an expiration date (typically one year). If the profile is not renewed by IT, the app will immediately stop working and crash when opened.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Temporary Entry Visa" for apps. Most apps get a "Permanent Visa" from the public App Store. However, if the school makes its own private app just for its students, that app only gets a "Temporary Visa" (the Provisioning Profile) that lasts for one year. If the school forgot to renew the visa, the app "gets kicked out" and won't open anymore until it gets its new paperwork.
