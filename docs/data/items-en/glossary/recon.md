## Definition

Recon (short for `Jamf recon`) is one of the most frequently used commands within the Jamf binary on macOS. When executed, it triggers the device to immediately collect and report its latest inventory data—including hardware health, installed software, user details, and customized **Extension Attributes**—back to the Jamf Pro server. It is typically the first step in troubleshooting a managed Mac.

## Plain English

Think of this as an "Instant Health Checkup." Normally, a computer might only send its status report once a day. If you run the "Recon" command, you're telling the Mac to immediately re-count its apps, check its storage, and send its latest "Health Report" back to the tech office right now, without waiting for its scheduled check-in.
