## Definition

Patch Management is the process of automated distribution and installation of updates (patches) for three-party software, such as Chrome, Zoom, or Adobe Creative Cloud. Jamf Pro’s Patch Management feature allows administrators to subscribe to official software update feeds, ensuring that as soon as a security flaw is fixed by the developer, the updated version is automatically pushed to all school Macs to keep them secure.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Automatic Security Repairs." When a software company finds a "hole" (a bug) in their program, they release a "patch" to fix it. IT uses Patch Management to make sure that as soon as a fix is available, it is automatically applied to every computer in the school. It’s like having a maintenance team that automatically fixes every leaky pipe in school the moment it's found.
