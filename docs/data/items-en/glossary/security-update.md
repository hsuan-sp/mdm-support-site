## Definition

A Security Update is a specifically released software patch designed to fix vulnerabilities in the operating system. Unlike a standard "Feature Update," security updates focus purely on protecting the device from being hacked or infected by malware. MDM can be used to mandate that these updates are installed automatically in the background, ensuring that the school's "digital shield" is always up-to-date.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Booster Shot" for your device. Just as a vaccine helps your body recognize and fight off new diseases without making you feel different, a Security Update teaches your iPad how to beat new computer viruses. It doesn't change how the device looks or give you new features, but it keeps you safe from invisible threats.
