## Definition

In Jamf Pro, "Scope" defines the specific set of devices or users that will receive a particular management task, configuration profile, or app. Administrators can fine-tune the scope to include "All Devices," specific "Smart Groups," or even use "Exclusions" to prevent certain devices from receiving a policy. For example: "Deploy the Science App to all Grade 8 students (Target), but exclude those who are currently in the Music elective (Exclusion)."

## Plain English

This is the "Task List" for a job. Just as a teacher might say, "Everyone in the class (Target) needs to do the homework, except for John, who was sick yesterday (Exclusion)," Scope is the list of who gets the new app and who doesn't. It helps IT make sure the right tools end up in the right hands.
