## Definition

Recovery Mode is a special built-in state on Apple devices used for troubleshooting and system maintenance. It allows users to reinstall the operating system, repair disk errors, or restore the device from a backup when the standard system fails to start correctly. On modern Macs, entering Recovery Mode requires a specific physical gesture (long-pressing the power button) and may be protected by a **Recovery Lock**.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Emergency Rescue Room." If your computer gets so "sick" that it can't even start up normally, you send it to this room to get fixed. Here, the "Doctor" (the system) can fix its hard drive or completely reinstall its "brain" (the OS) to get it working like new again. It’s the final safety net for fixing a broken device.
