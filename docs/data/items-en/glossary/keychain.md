## Definition

The Keychain is Apple’s built-in password management system. It securely stores a user’s website passwords, Wi-Fi credentials, private keys, and digital certificates using strong encryption. Once a user logs in to their device, the Keychain automatically provides the necessary credentials for various apps and websites, eliminating the need to manually re-enter passwords.

## Plain English

Think of this as the system's "Universal Key Ring." You don't have to carry around dozens of individual keys (your passwords) in your head; you just keep them in this secure, encrypted "Lockbox" (the Keychain). Once you unlock the box with your fingerprint or startup password, the system automatically grabs whichever key you need to unlock a website or the school Wi-Fi.
