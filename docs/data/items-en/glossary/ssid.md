## Term Definition

An SSID is the broadcast name of a Wi-Fi network. Schools often have multiple SSIDs (e.g., "TES-Student", "TES-Guest") to provide different levels of access and security.

## Analogy

An SSID is the **"Name Above the Classroom Door."** When you walk through the hallway, you see "Year 5" and "Year 6." You choose the room that matches your badge. On your iPad, you choose the Wi-Fi "room" (the SSID) that matches your campus role to get the right level of internet access.
