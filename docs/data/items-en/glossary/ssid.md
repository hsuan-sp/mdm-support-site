## Term Definition

An **SSID (Service Set Identifier)** is the technical term for the name of a Wi-Fi network broadcast by a router.

Common school setup:

* **School-Secure**: Encrypted network using WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise (802.1X) for managed devices.

* **School-Guest**: Open or password-protected network for visitors, isolated from internal servers.

* **Hidden SSID**: A network that does not broadcast its name (a weak security measure, often discouraged).

## Analogy

An SSID is the **"Name Above the Classroom Door."**

When you walk through the hallway, you see "Year 5", "Year 6", and "Staff Room." You choose the room that matches your badge.

On your iPad, you choose the Wi-Fi **"Room"** (the SSID) that matches your actual campus role to get the right level of internet access.
