## Term Definition

**Enrollment Customization** allows organizations to deliver a tailored onboarding experience during the **Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)** process.

Customization options:

* **Branding**: Display school logos, custom welcome text, and contact information.

* **Policies**: Require users to read and accept Apple’s and the school’s **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)** before proceeding.

* **Authentication**: Use modern identity providers (Azure AD, Okta, Google) to verify the user's identity before enrollment is completed.

* **Workflow**: Create a multi-step sequence of setup screens that are unique to the organization.

## Analogy

This is the device's **"Welcome Lobby"** or **"Registration Desk."**

Just like a new student's first day involves visiting a welcome center to get their ID badge and sign the school rules, this feature puts that exact experience right on the iPad or Mac screen.

Before the student can even reach the Home Screen, they see the school's logo and must **"sign"** the rules, ensuring everyone is on the same page and properly identified from day one.
