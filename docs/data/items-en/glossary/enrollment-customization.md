## Definition

Enrollment Customization allows organizations to display a custom interface during the Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) process. This interface can include welcome screens, acceptable use policies (AUP), or integration with modern identity providers for authentication. It ensures that students and staff see important school branding and legal agreements before they even reach the home screen.

## Plain English

This is the device's "Welcome Lobby." Just like a new student's first day involves a welcome packet and signing school rules at the front desk, this feature puts that experience right on the iPad screen. Before the student can use the device, they see the school's logo and must "sign" the rules, ensuring everyone is on the same page from day one.
