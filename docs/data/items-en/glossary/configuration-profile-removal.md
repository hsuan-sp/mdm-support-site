## Term Definition

**Configuration Profile Removal** is an MDM directive that remotely uninstalls a specific management profile and its associated payload from a device.

Consequences of removal:

* **Instant Deletion**: Wi-Fi credentials, VPN configurations, and security restrictions are removed immediately.

* **Certificate Revocation**: Any digital certificates included in the profile are deleted from the device's keychain.

* **Resource Recovery**: Essential for offboarding users or clearing organizational data before a device is reassigned.

## Analogy

This is the **"Take It Back"** button for IT.

When a student graduates or an employee leaves the company, IT can click one button to remotely **"reclaim"** all the school’s digital property—like the secret Wi-Fi password and specific campus settings—leaving the device clean and ready for its next owner.
