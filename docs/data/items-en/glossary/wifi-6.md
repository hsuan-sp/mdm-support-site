## Term Definition

**Wi-Fi 6**(IEEE 802.11ax) is the wireless standard that succeeded Wi-Fi 5, focusing on**efficiency**and capacity in crowded environments rather than just raw peak speed.

Key improvements for schools:

* **OFDMA**: Allows one transmission to deliver data to multiple devices at once (like a delivery truck making multiple stops), reducing latency in classrooms with 30+ iPads.
* **Target Wake Time (TWT)**: Allows devices to "sleep" and wake up only when scheduled to send data, significantly saving battery life on iPads and MacBooks.
* **BSS Coloring**: Reduces interference from neighboring classrooms' Wi-Fi networks.

## Analogy

Think of this as a**"Smart Bus System."**

**Wi-Fi 5**was like a fleet of cars carrying one person each. If 30 students needed data, 30 cars had to line up, causing a traffic jam.
**Wi-Fi 6**uses**OFDMA**, which is like a**bus**. One bus can pick up data for 30 students at once and deliver it in a single trip. The road is less crowded, and everyone gets to their destination (website) smoother and faster, even during a busy lesson.
