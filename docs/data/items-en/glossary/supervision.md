## Definition

Supervision is a special mode for school-owned Apple devices that provides advanced management capabilities. It allows the school to enforce stricter controls, such as silent app installation, "Single App Mode" (Kiosk mode), and preventing the removal of the management profile.

## Plain English

Supervision is the device's "School Asset Mode." A personal iPhone you buy from a store is in "Personal Mode"—most settings cannot be locked down. Once a device is supervised, it is recognized as "school property." This unlocks full management capabilities for IT: they can lock down any feature, silently push apps, enforce kiosk modes, and prevent the removal of the management profile. It's the essential requirement for any school-owned iPad.
