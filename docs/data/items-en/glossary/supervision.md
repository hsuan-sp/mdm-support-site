## Definition

Supervision is a special mode for school-owned Apple devices that provides advanced management capabilities. It allows the school to enforce stricter controls, such as silent app installation, "Single App Mode" (Kiosk mode), and preventing the removal of the management profile.

## Plain English

Supervision is the difference between a **"Library Book"** and a **"School Notebook."** A library book (personal device) is borrowed but fairly private. A school supervised device, however, is like a specialized laboratory tool assigned for a specific purpose—it’s built to be managed, and the student "owns" the experience but the school "governs" the rules of the tool to keep it safe and focused on learning.
