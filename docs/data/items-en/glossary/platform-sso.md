## Definition

Platform Single Sign-On (Platform SSO) is an advanced feature introduced in macOS 13+ that deeply integrates a user’s local Mac login with their institutional cloud identity (such as Google Workspace or Microsoft Entra ID). When a user logs in to their Mac, the system automatically authenticates them with the school's cloud services in the background, allowing for a seamless transition into all school-approved apps and websites without re-entering passwords.

## Plain English

This is the "All-Access School Pass." In the past, you might have needed one password for your computer and another for your email. Platform SSO combines them. As soon as you log in to your Mac with your face or fingerprint, the computer automatically "tells" all the school apps like Google Drive and Zoom that you are officially logged in, so you don't have to type your password again and again.
