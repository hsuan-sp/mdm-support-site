## Term Definition

**Jamf Safe Internet** is a comprehensive network security and content filtering service designed specifically for educational institutions.

Protective features:

* **Filtering**: Blocks access to inappropriate or dangerous categories of websites (e.g., adult content, gambling, or piracy).

* **Phishing Defense**: Identifies and blocks malicious links designed to steal school login credentials.

* **Reporting**: Provides administrators with insights into web usage trends and security threats.

* **Deployment**: Integrated directly into Jamf Pro or Jamf School for easy "no-touch" rollout to student devices.

Because it operates at the DNS level, it protects students whether they are using the school Wi-Fi or their home network.

## Analogy

Think of this as your **"Digital Bodyguard."**

Before you load any website, the bodyguard quickly checks the "address" to make sure it isn't a scam or a dangerous hidden site. If it's a **"bad neighborhood"** on the internet, the bodyguard steps in and blocks the site immediately.

It works everywhere—protecting you and the school's private data from hackers and harmful content whether you're in the classroom or at the park.
