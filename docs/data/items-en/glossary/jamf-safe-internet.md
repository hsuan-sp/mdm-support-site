## Plain English

Think of this as your "Digital Bodyguard." Before you load any website, the bodyguard quickly checks the address to make sure it isn't a scam or a dangerous site. If it's a "bad neighborhood" on the internet, the bodyguard steps in and blocks the site, protecting you and the school's data from hackers and harmful content.
