## Definition

Universal Control is a powerful Continuity feature that allows users to seamlessly control multiple Macs or iPads using a single set of mouse/trackpad and keyboard. The cursor can move across the screen boundaries of adjacent devices, and files can be dragged and dropped between hardware as if they were one unified system. MDM can be used to manage or disable this feature to meet specific school data isolation requirements.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Cursor Teleportation." If you place your iPad next to your Mac, your mouse has the superpower to glide right off the edge of the computer screen and appear instantly on the iPad screen. You can even grab a photo from your iPad and drag it onto your Mac to paste it into a report. It makes your two separate devices feel like one giant, powerful computer.
