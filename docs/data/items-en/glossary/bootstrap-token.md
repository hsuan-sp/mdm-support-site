## Term Definition

A **Bootstrap Token** is a secure authorization credential used within the macOS management framework to facilitate administration.

Operational flow:

* **Generation**: When the first user enables **FileVault** encryption on a Mac, the system generates this token.

* **Escrow**: The token is securely uploaded and stored in the MDM server.

* **Utility**: MDM uses this token to authorize other administrator accounts or to allow **software updates** that require a cryptographic "owner" to proceed.

This ensures that IT can maintain a device even when the primary user is not present or when the device is in a locked, encrypted state.

## Analogy

This is the **"Backup Recovery Key"** stored in the school's digital vault.

When a computer is locked down with encryption (FileVault), usually only the primary user can unlock the door. The **Bootstrap Token** allows IT to have a secure copy of the "Master Key" so they can enter the system for maintenance or give access to a new employee if the original user has left.
