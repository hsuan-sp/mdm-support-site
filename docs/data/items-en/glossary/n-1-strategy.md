## Term Definition

An **N-1 Strategy** is a standard IT policy for defining software support lifecycles.

The formula:

* **N**: The current, latest major version of the operating system (e.g., iOS 18).

* **N-1**: The immediately preceding major version (e.g., iOS 17).

**Policy**: IT commits to fully supporting only these two versions. Devices running older software (**N-2**, e.g., iOS 16) are considered "End of Life" for support purposes. They may still work, but IT will not troubleshoot issues or guarantee that new apps will function on them.

## Analogy

Think of this as the **"Manufacturer's Warranty"** for software.

Just as a car company might keep spare parts for the newest model and the previous one, software companies (and school IT) focus their energy on the current version and the one just before it.

If your iPad is running a system that is 3 or 4 years old, it’s like driving a vintage car—parts are hard to find, and the mechanic might not be able to fix it anymore.
