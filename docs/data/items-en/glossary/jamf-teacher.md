## Definition

Jamf Teacher is a powerful classroom management app designed for educators. It allows teachers to instantly manage student iPads by locking them into specific apps, creating "web-safe" lists of approved sites, and pushing out educational content. Integrated with the school’s MDM, it provides a more granular and education-focused level of control than standard management tools.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Digital Pointer" for the modern classroom. Instead of a teacher having to walk around the room to see what every student is doing, they can use this app on their own iPad to keep everyone focused. With one button, the teacher can make sure all 30 students are looking at the same textbook page, preventing anyone from getting distracted by games or social media.
