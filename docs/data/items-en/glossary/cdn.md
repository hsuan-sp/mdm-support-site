## Term Definition

A **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** is a system of geographically distributed servers that work together to provide fast delivery of internet content.

In Apple management environments:

* **Updates**: Apple uses CDNs to cache large files like **macOS installers** or **iOS updates** near the school.

* **Speed**: When hundreds of devices request an update simultaneously, the traffic is served by a local node rather than pulling from Apple’s primary servers.

* **Bandwidth**: This reduces latency and prevents school-wide internet congestion during major deployment phases.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Local Grocery Store"** for the internet.

Instead of every school having to drive to the main central warehouse (Apple’s headquarters in California) to get their supplies (updates), Apple sends the supplies ahead of time to local **"Convenience Stores"** (CDNs) right in your neighborhood.

When it's time to update, the school just picks up the files from the local store, which is much faster and doesn't clog up the main highways for everyone else.
