## Term Definition

Introduced in **macOS Tahoe**, this transparency feature enhances user awareness of privacy management.

Key features include:

* **Explicit Display**: App privacy permissions managed via MDM (such as Screen Recording or Full Disk Access) are shown in **System Settings > Privacy & Security**.

* **Managed Labels**: These permissions are clearly labeled as **"Managed by Organization."**

* **User Insight**: Users can see exactly what has been authorized by IT, promoting a transparent security environment.

### MDM Context

While this increases transparency, it may also lead to user questions about why certain apps have high-level permissions. IT should be prepared to explain these security authorizations to staff.

## Analogy

In the past, permissions granted by IT were "invisible." Now, they are listed on a **"Public Authorization List."**

Users can easily see which apps have been granted special permissions by the school's management system, improving trust and transparency.
