## Term Definition

**Notarization** is an automated security screening system provided by Apple for macOS software distributed outside the App Store.

The process:
1. **Submission**: A developer sends their app to Apple's notarization service.
2. **Scan**: Apple scans the code for known malware and security issues (but does not review the content).
3. **Ticket**: If clean, Apple issues a digital "ticket" (stapled to the app).
4. **Execution**: When a user opens the app, macOS **Gatekeeper** checks for this ticket. If present, the app is allowed to run. If missing, it is blocked.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Certificate of Good Health"** for software.

Just as food is inspected for safety before it reaches the supermarket shelf, Apple inspects software for "viruses" and "bugs."

If it passes the inspection, it gets a **"Safety Seal"** (the notarization). When you try to open the app, your Mac checks for that seal to make sure it’s safe for you to eat (use).
