## Term Definition

PreStage Enrollment is a Jamf Pro feature used to customize the initial setup experience for Apple devices. It allows IT to determine which setup screens a student sees (like Siri, Apple Pay, or Touch ID) and ensures the device is automatically organized into the correct department or grade level.

## Analogy

PreStage Enrollment is like a **"VIP Express Lane"** at airport check-in. Before the student even turns on their new iPad, the ICT department has already pre-filled their paperwork. The student skips all the boring setup questions and goes straight to their destination: a fully functional device ready for class.
