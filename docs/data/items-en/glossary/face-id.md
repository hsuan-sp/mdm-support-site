## Term Definition

**Face ID** is Apple’s advanced facial recognition biometric authentication system.

Technical security:

* **TrueDepth Camera**: Projects and analyzes over 30,000 invisible infrared dots to create a 3D mathematical model of the user's face.

* **Security Enclave**: The mathematical model is stored and processed locally on the device and is never sent to Apple or the cloud.

* **MDM Control**: Administrators can enforce the use of Face ID (or Touch ID) to unlock devices or access specific managed educational apps, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected even if a device is physically accessed by an unauthorized person.

## Analogy

This is **"3D Facial Scanning."**

It doesn't just take a flat photo; it scans the actual depth and shape of your face using invisible light beams. Even if someone has a high-quality 2D photo or a professional mask of you, they can’t trick the system.

It’s a fast, convenient, and incredibly secure way to make sure that the **correct student**—and only that student—is using the device.
