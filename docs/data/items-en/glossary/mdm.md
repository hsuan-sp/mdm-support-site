## Term Definition

Mobile Device Management (MDM) is a security and administrative protocol used to oversee Apple hardware. By installing a management profile, the school can remotely push commands, configure settings (like campus Wi-Fi), and deploy educational apps across the entire fleet of iPads and Macs.

## Analogy

Think of MDM as a **"Remote Control for the School District."** Instead of manually configuring every student's iPad, the IT team has a centralized dashboard. If a new library app is needed or a security update is released, the school can "broadcast" these changes to hundreds of devices at once, ensuring every student has the same set of tools.
