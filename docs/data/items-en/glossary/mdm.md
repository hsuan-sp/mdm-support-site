## Term Definition

**Mobile Device Management (MDM)** is the standard framework for managing Apple hardware in an organization.

Core capabilities:

* **Configuration**: Pushing settings for Wi-Fi, Email, and VPN.

* **Security**: Enforcing passcodes, encryption, and restricting features like the camera.

* **Deployment**: Installing and updating apps and books remotely.

* **Inventory**: Reporting on device status, OS version, and installed software.

MDM relies on the Apple Push Notification service (APNs) to maintain constant contact with devices.

## Analogy

Think of MDM as a **"Remote Control for the School District."**

Instead of an IT person having to physically touch and configure every single student's iPad one by one, they have a centralized dashboard.

If a new library app is needed or a security update is released, the school can **"broadcast"** these changes to hundreds of devices at once, ensuring every student has the exact same set of tools ready for class.
