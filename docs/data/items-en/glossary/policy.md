# Term Definition
In Jamf Pro, a Policy is a set of management instructions applied to Macs. Policies are triggered by specific events—such as logging in, starting up, or on a recurring schedule—to perform tasks like installing software or running maintenance scripts.

# Analogy
A Policy is like a **"School Bell Schedule."** You don't have to announce "Go to Class" every day manually. The bell (the Trigger) automatically signals to students what they should be doing at that exact moment. Similarly, a policy tells the computer: "Every time you wake up, check if the latest security patch is installed."
