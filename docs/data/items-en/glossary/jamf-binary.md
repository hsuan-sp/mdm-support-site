## Definition

The Jamf Binary (often referred to as the `Jamf` command) is the core management agent installed on macOS devices. It acts as the local "Engine" for Jamf Pro, communicating with the server to trigger management policies, install software, and report inventory data. While iOS devices use Apple’s native MDM framework directly, macOS devices rely on this additional binary to perform advanced management tasks like running custom scripts.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "On-Site Manager" living inside your Mac. While the main school office (the MDM server) gives the orders, the On-Site Manager is the one who actually does the work—like installing your apps, fixing your settings, and making sure the computer is following the school rules. Without this silent helper working in the background, the school wouldn't be able to support your Mac remotely.
