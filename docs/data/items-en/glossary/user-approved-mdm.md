## Definition

User Approved MDM is a security requirement on macOS for devices that were not enrolled via **Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)**. When a management profile is installed manually, a local administrator must go to System Settings and explicitly "approve" the management task. Only a User Approved MDM account has the authority to manage sensitive security settings, such as installing Kernel Extensions or enforcing advanced security policies.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Certificate of Permission." If you hire someone to manage your house for you, you need to sign an official document to give them the keys to the main doors. Without that signed approval, the manager (the MDM) can only do basic things like cleaning the windows; they aren't allowed to touch the main security locks until you have personally said, "Yes, I trust them."
