## Term Definition

**Wi-Fi 6E** is the extension of the Wi-Fi 6 standard into the 6 GHz frequency band.

Advantages for schools:

* **Spectrum**: Adds huge amounts of new "airspace" (1200 MHz) exclusively for 6E devices, avoiding interference from older Wi-Fi 5 devices.

* **Speed**: Supports **160MHz channels**, effectively doubling the throughput for compatible devices (iPad Pro M2+, MacBook Pro M2+).

* **Latency**: Significantly reduces lag, critical for AR/VR applications and high-density classroom testing.

## Analogy

Think of this as **"Adding a Double-Decker Express Highway"** to the school's internet.

Most Wi-Fi works on "crowded local streets." Wi-Fi 6E opens up a brand-new, wider highway where modern iPads can travel twice as fast without getting stuck in **"internet traffic"** caused by older phones and laptops.

It makes downloading large textbooks and projects feel almost instant.
