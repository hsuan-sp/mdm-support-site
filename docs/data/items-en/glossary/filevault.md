## Term Definition

FileVault is a full-disk encryption feature for macOS. It ensures that all data on the startup disk is encrypted and can only be accessed by authorized users. For school-managed Macs, the "Recovery Key" is securely stored in the MDM server.

## Analogy

FileVault is like **"Scrambling the School’s Filing Cabinet."** Even if a thief physically steals the hard drive out of a teacher's laptop, they cannot read any of the files because the data is written in a secret code. Only the person with the "Decipher Key" (the user’s login or the IT department’s recovery key) can turn that gibberish back into readable documents.
