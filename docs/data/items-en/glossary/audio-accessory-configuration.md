## Term Definition

Introduced in**iOS/iPadOS 26**(`com.apple.configuration.audio-accessory.settings`), this MDM payload improves audio accessory management in collaborative environments.

Key management features:

* **Temporary Pairing**: Allows supervised devices to pair with AirPods or Beats headphones temporarily.
* **iCloud Bypass**: Prevents pairing information from syncing to the user's personal iCloud account.
* **Shared iPad Optimization**: Designed specifically to ensure that accessory connections are cleared when a student logs out.

## MDM Context

This solves the long-standing problem of AirPods pairing conflicts in shared labs. It ensures that students don't accidentally connect to a set of headphones used by someone else in a previous class.

## Analogy

Previously, pairing AirPods was like**"Getting Married"**—the connection followed you everywhere via iCloud and was hard to break.

Now, in shared school environments, it's like a**"Temporary Rental."**You pair the headphones while you're in the lab, but when you log out, the iPad**"forgets"**the connection instantly so it doesn't interfere with the next student.
