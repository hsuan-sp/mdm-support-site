## Definition

iCloud Backup automatically saves a device’s app data, settings, and photos to Apple’s cloud storage when the device is connected to Wi-Fi, locked, and charging (usually overnight). This ensures that if a student’s iPad is damaged or lost, their work can be quickly restored onto a new device. MDM can be used to mandate or restrict this feature based on the school's data privacy policies.

## Plain English

This is the "Automatic Digital Safety Net." Every night when the student's iPad is charging and connected to Wi-Fi, it quietly packs up all their work, photos, and settings and stores a copy safely in the cloud. If the iPad is broken the next morning, IT can just give the student a new one, and their entire "digital life" will come back exactly as it was.
