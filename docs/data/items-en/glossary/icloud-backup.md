# Term Definition
iCloud Backup automatically saves a copy of the student's device data (like app data and settings) to Apple's secure cloud storage. For Managed Apple Accounts, students receive 200GB of storage.

# Analogy
iCloud Backup is like an **"Automatic Digital Locker."** Every night, the iPad takes all the student's work and places it safely in a locker in the sky. If an iPad is lost or broken, the student can just open a new locker (a new device), and all their homework, drawings, and notes reappear as if nothing ever happened.
