## Term Definition

**"Install Later"** is a smart deployment strategy used for macOS and iOS system updates to minimize user disruption.

Workflow details:

* **Background Download**: The device downloads the large update files while the user continues their work, ensuring the "heavy lifting" is done without interruption.

* **Scheduling**: The actual installation—which requires a restart—is scheduled for a later time, typically when the device is inactive (e.g., late at night).

* **Flexibility**: The user can also choose to manually trigger the installation at a more convenient time once the files are ready.

This strategy ensures that critical security patches are delivered without suddenly "kicking a student off" their device during a class or exam.

## Analogy

Think of this as **"Scheduling a Home Renovation."**

The school IT team **"delivers the building materials"** (downloads the update) while the student is busy using the iPad for class. However, the actually noisy and disruptive **"construction work"** (the installation and restart) doesn't start until the student is finished with their homework and has gone to sleep.

This way, the iPad is fully updated and ready to go the next morning without ever interrupting a single minute of learning.
