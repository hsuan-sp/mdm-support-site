## Definition

Remote Management is the screen or status that appears on an Apple device during setup, indicating that the device is being configured by the school's MDM server. It confirms the organization's ownership and sets initial boundaries.

## Plain English

Remote Management is the **"School’s Digital Stamp."** When you first open your iPad, this screen is like the device holding up a badge saying: "I’m a representative of Taipei European School." It’s the hand-off where the iPad officially accepts the school’s rules and begins its journey as a learning tool.
