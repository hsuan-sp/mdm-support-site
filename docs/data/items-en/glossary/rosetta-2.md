## Term Definition

**Rosetta 2** is a dynamic binary translator developed by Apple for the transition from Intel chips to Apple Silicon (M-series).

Function:

* **Translation**: It instantly converts instructions written for Intel processors (x86_64) into instructions that Apple Silicon (ARM64) can understand.

* **transparency**: Users typically don't realize it is running; apps just open and work.

* **Deployment**: IT can use MDM to pre-install Rosetta 2 on all new Macs. This prevents users from seeing a confusing "You need to install Rosetta" prompt when they try to open older software like Adobe Photoshop or older printer drivers.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Live Language Translator."**

The new M-series Macs speak one language (English), while older software speaks another (French).

**Rosetta 2** sits in the middle and translates everything instantly, so your favorite older apps can still talk to your brand-new computer. It's like having a dedicated interpreter follow you around so you don't even notice the language barrier.
