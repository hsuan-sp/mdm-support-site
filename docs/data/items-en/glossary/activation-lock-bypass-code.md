## Definition

An Activation Lock Bypass Code is a unique alphanumeric string that MDM automatically collects from Supervised devices. In situations where an employee or student leaves the organization without signing out of their personal Apple Account—leaving the device locked—an IT administrator can enter this code to bypass the lock and erase the device for reuse.

## Plain English

This is the "Emergency Override Key" for institution-owned hardware. If someone leaves the school and forgets to unlock their iPad, IT doesn't have to guess their password. They can pull this code from the MDM system, enter it into the device, and the "theft lock" is instantly removed so the iPad can be wiped and given to a new student.
