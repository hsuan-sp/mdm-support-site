## Definition

jamfHelper is a built-in messaging utility for macOS management. IT administrators use it via scripts to display custom dialog boxes, notification windows, or progress bars to the user. It is the primary tool for informing users about required software updates, gathering simple user input, or providing visual feedback during the execution of a management policy.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Digital Bulletin Board." It’s the tool the IT team uses to put a message on your screen when something important is happening—like when your computer needs to restart for an update. It’s a simple way for the tech team to talk to you through your computer screen so you always know what’s going on.
