## Definition

A Student Information System (SIS) is a comprehensive database school management platform used to store and manage student records, attendance, grades, schedules, and family contact information. Apple School Manager (ASM) can integrate with popular SIS providers to automatically sync student and teacher IDs and class rosters, eliminating the massive task of manually creating thousands of Managed Apple Accounts.

## Plain English

This is the "Digital Brain of the School Office." It's the central hub that knows every student's name, which class they are in, and who their parents are. By connecting this "Brain" to the school's iPad system, everything stays synchronized. If a new student joins the school, the system automatically gives them an iPad account and puts them in the correct classes without any extra paperwork.
