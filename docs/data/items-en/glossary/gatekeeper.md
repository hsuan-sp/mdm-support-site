## Term Definition

Gatekeeper is a macOS technology that ensures only trusted software runs on the computer. It verifies that applications have been "Notarized" by Apple or come from the App Store, protecting the system from malware or unauthorized software.

## Analogy

Gatekeeper is like a **"Campus Security Guard"** checking for visitor badges. When a new piece of software tries to "enter" the Mac, the guard asks: "Do you have an official badge from Apple?" If the software isn't recognized or authorized, Gatekeeper blocks it from running, ensuring that students aren't accidentally installing harmful programs.
