## Term Definition

**Gatekeeper** is a macOS internal security technology designed to protect users from malicious or untrusted software.

Protective measures:

* **Verification**: Checks downloaded applications for a valid Apple Developer ID signature.

* **Notarization**: Verifies that the app has been scanned and "notarized" by Apple’s automated security systems to be free of known malware.

* **In-Place Enforcement**: If an app is from an unknown source or has been tampered with, Gatekeeper prevents it from opening.

Administrators use MDM to standardize Gatekeeper settings across the school, ensuring only approved and safe software can be launched by students.

## Analogy

This is the Mac's **"Software Customs Officer."**

Whenever you try to run a program you downloaded from the internet, the officer (Gatekeeper) stops it to check if it has a valid entry visa (notarization) from Apple.

If the program looks suspicious, comes from an untrusted source, or hasn't been properly cleared, the officer will block the door and refuse to let it run, keeping your Mac safe from viruses and digital "intruders."
