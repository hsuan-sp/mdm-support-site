## Term Definition

**Apple Intelligence Management** refers to the MDM controls introduced in **iOS 18.1** and **macOS 15.1** to govern generative AI capabilities.

Organizations can manage:

* **Content Analysis**: Whether AI tools can analyze user content (emails, documents, and transcripts).

* **Data Transmission**: Control over data sent to the **Private Cloud Compute (PCC)** layer.

* **Privacy Compliance**: Ensuring that sensitive institutional data is not used for model training or inadvertently processed.

This maintains strict data privacy while allowing users to benefit from AI-powered productivity tools.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Privacy Shield for AI."**

While Apple Intelligence provides powerful new tools to help with writing and organization, the school can choose to turn off certain features to make sure your work and private messages aren't being "read" or "learned" by the AI. It keeps the school’s most sensitive secrets safe from being analyzed by a computer program.
