## Term Definition

An **Identity Provider (IdP)** is a specialized service that creates, maintains, and manages digital identities and authentication.

Common IdPs in Education:

* **Google Workspace**

* **Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)**

* **Okta**

**MDM Role**: In a modern setup, MDM does not manage passwords itself. Instead, it "outsources" authentication to the IdP. When a student tries to enroll an iPad, the MDM sends a request to the IdP (e.g., Google) to verify the password. This enables **Single Sign-On (SSO)**, allowing students to use one single password for their iPad, their email, and their learning portal.

## Analogy

Think of this as the **"Global School ID Office."**

Instead of every individual website, app, or iPad needing to keep its own private list of 500 students and their passwords, they all just call the **ID Office** and ask, "Is this person actually who they say they are?".

Once the ID Office confirms it's them, the person is granted access to the building. This means students only have **one single "Master Password"** to remember for everything related to school.
