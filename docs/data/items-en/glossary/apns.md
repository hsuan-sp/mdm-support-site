## Term Definition

Apple Push Notification service (APNs) is the critical communication bridge between the MDM server and a device. When the school’s administrator sends a command (like "Install App"), it passes through APNs to reach the student's device. A valid APNs certificate—renewed annually—is essential for the MDM to maintain contact with devices.

## Analogy

APNs is like the **"School’s Internal Mail System."** When the IT office wants an iPad to perform a task, they don't walk to the student; they send a specialized "notice" through the Apple Postal Service. If the school’s mail permit (the certificate) is expired, the iPads won't receive any instructions, and the "Remote Control" stops working.
