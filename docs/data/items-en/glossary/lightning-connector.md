## Term Definition

The **Lightning Connector** is Apple's proprietary 8-pin physical data and power interface.

Hardware context:

* **Usage**: Standard port for iPhone 5 through iPhone 14, and entry-level iPads up until the 9th Generation.

* **Comparison**: Supports USB 2.0 speeds (slower than modern USB-C).

* **Phased Out**: While modern devices now use **USB-C** to comply with international regulations, Lightning is still prevalent in education due to the long lifespan of iPad fleets.

* **Design**: Reversible design, allowing the cable to be plugged in face up or face down.

## Analogy

This is the **"Classic"** Apple charging port.

Unlike the new, oval-shaped **USB-C** ports that you see on the latest iPads and laptops, the Lightning cable is the smaller, flat connector that only works with older Apple devices.

While it's getting phased out like old DVD players, school "iPad carts" often still have hundreds of these cables to keep the older student tablets charged and ready for class.
