## Term Definition

**Account-Driven Device Enrollment** is a modernized method for enrolling personal devices in a **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** environment.

The process is streamlined:

1. Users sign in with their **Managed Apple Account** directly in the Settings app.

2. The system automatically detects the organization's MDM and guides the user through enrollment.

This method enforces a strict **separation between work and personal data**. The organization can only manage business apps and specific professional settings, while personal photos, messages, and accounts remain completely private and inaccessible to the IT department.

## Analogy

This is a **"Log-in to Manage"** mechanism.

It is as simple as signing into your work email. Once you log in, your phone creates a separate **"Work Partition"** for company apps and files.

If you ever leave the company and log out, that entire partition disappears instantly, leaving your personal data completely untouched.
