## Definition

The NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Benchmarks are a globally recognized set of cybersecurity standards. Many educational departments (including those in Taiwan and international school groups) have adopted these benchmarks as the official "Safety Checklist" for student iPads. Key requirements include 6-digit complex passcodes, enforced automatic updates, and data encryption to ensure student privacy and institutional security.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Digital Safety Inspection Certificate" for school iPads. Just like a school building has to pass a fire safety inspection (checking for fire extinguishers and clear exits), every iPad must pass this "Digital Inspection" to prove it is safe enough for students to use. It ensures that the tablet has strong locks, stays up-to-date, and keeps your private work safe from hackers.
