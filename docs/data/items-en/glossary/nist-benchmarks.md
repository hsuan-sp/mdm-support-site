## Term Definition

The **NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Benchmarks** are a globally recognized set of cybersecurity best practices.

Educational adoption:

* **Baseline**: Many government education departments adopt these standards as the minimum requirement for school-owned devices.

* **Requirements**: Typically mandate a 6-digit complex passcode, automatic OS updates, 15-minute auto-lock timers, and full-disk encryption.

* **Compliance**: MDM systems use these benchmarks to "audit" device fleets and flag any iPad that is not secure enough.

## Analogy

Think of this as the **"Digital Safety Inspection Certificate."**

Just as a school building has to pass a fire safety inspection (checking for fire extinguishers and clear exits), every iPad must pass this **"Digital Inspection"** to prove it is safe enough for students to use.

It ensures that the tablet has strong locks, stays up-to-date, and keeps your private work safe from hackers, just like a building code keeps you safe from fires.
