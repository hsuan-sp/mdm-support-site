## Term Definition

AirDrop is a wireless file-sharing protocol that uses Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to send documents, photos, and links between Apple devices. In a school setting,teachers can use Apple Classroom to manage or restrict AirDrop visibility.

## Analogy

AirDrop is like **"Passing a Note in Class (Digitally)."** If a teacher wants to share a PDF worksheet with everyone in the room, they don't need to send 30 emails. They can just "beam" it through the air. It’s a fast, cable-free way to collaborate and move resources around the classroom instantly.
