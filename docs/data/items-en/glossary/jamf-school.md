## Definition

Jamf School is a purpose-built MDM solution designed specifically for the K-12 education market. It features a simplified interface and specific tools for teachers and parents to manage leaners' iPads. While Jamf Pro is designed for IT experts, Jamf School focuses on ease of use for educators, providing streamlined classroom management, app distribution, and integration with Apple School Manager.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Education Edition" of the management software. While the professional version is built for engineers, Jamf School is built for teachers. It makes it easy for a teacher to manage a classroom of 30 iPads without needing an engineering degree, while still giving the school the security and control it needs.
