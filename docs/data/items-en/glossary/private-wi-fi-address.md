## Definition

A Private Wi-Fi Address is a security feature in iOS and iPadOS that uses a randomized MAC address to prevent network operators from tracking a device over time. While this improves user privacy on public hotspots, it can cause connection issues on schoool networks that rely on **MAC Binding** (identifying specific devices by their unique hardware ID). Administrators often recommend turning this feature off for official school Wi-Fi networks to ensure a stable connection.

## Plain English

This is a "Digital Alias" or "Stage Name." When your iPad connects to Wi-Fi at a shopping mall, it uses a fake name so the mall can't track where you go next. However, at school, the "Gatekeeper" (the Wi-Fi router) needs to know your "Real Name" (your real hardware ID) to make sure you are a student and let you online. If you keep using a fake name, the school Wi-Fi might not recognize you and could block your connection.
