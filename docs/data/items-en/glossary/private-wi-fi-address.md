## Term Definition

**Private Wi-Fi Address** is a privacy feature in iOS, iPadOS, and macOS that uses MAC address randomization.

How it works:

* **Randomization**: Instead of using its permanent hardware MAC address, the device generates a unique, random MAC address for each Wi-Fi network (SSID) it joins.

* **Rotation**: In some settings, this address may rotate periodically (e.g., every 24 hours or 2 weeks).

* **Pro**: Prevents marketing trackers in shopping malls from building a profile of your movement.

* **Con**: Breaks education networks that rely on **MAC Address Filtering** or **DHCP Reservations** to identify specific student devices.

## Analogy

This is a **"Digital Stage Name."**

When your iPad connects to Wi-Fi at a Starbucks, it uses a fake name so the shop can't track that you come there every day.

However, at school, the **"Gatekeeper"** (the Wi-Fi router) needs to know your **"Real Name"** (Hardware ID) to confirm you are a student and let you in. If you keep using a fake name, the school Wi-Fi might not recognize you and could lock you out.
