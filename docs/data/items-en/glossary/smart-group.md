## Term Definition

A Smart Group is a dynamic category in Jamf that automatically populates devices based on specific criteria (e.g., "iPads with low battery" or "Macs missing a specific update"). As device attributes change, they automatically join or leave the group.

## Analogy

A Smart Group is an **"Automatic Sorting Bin."** You set a rule: "If a student iPad has less than 10% battery, put it in the 'Needs Charge' list." The system constantly checks every device; as soon as one drops to 9%, it’s moved to that list automatically. No manual checking required.
