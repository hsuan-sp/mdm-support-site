## Term Definition

**USB-C** is the universal connector standard used by modern Apple devices (iPad 10+, MacBook, iPhone 15+).

Capabilities:

* **Power**: High-wattage charging (Power Delivery).

* **Data**: High-speed file transfer (up to 40Gbps with Thunderbolt).

* **Video**: Connects directly to projectors and monitors.

* **Accessories**: Supports ethernet dongles, microphones, and hard drives.

**MDM Context**: Because USB-C makes it so easy to plug in flash drives, schools often use **"USB Restricted Mode"** profiles to stop students from copying school data onto personal drives.

## Analogy

Think of this as the **"Universal Connection Hole."**

In the old days, you had different cables for charging (Lightning), connecting to a screen (HDMI), and moving files (USB-A). Now, one single **USB-C** port does it all.

It’s faster, the cable works even if you flip it upside down, and it makes it much easier to keep your iPad charged and ready for the school day.
