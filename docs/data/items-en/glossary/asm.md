# Term Definition
Apple School Manager (ASM) is a web-based portal used by the school’s IT department. It serves as the "Hub" for managing student accounts, purchasing app licenses in bulk, and assigning hardware to management servers. It bridges the gap between the school’s administrative records and their Apple devices.

# Analogy
ASM is the **"Digital Registrar’s Office."** It is where the school creates "birth certificates" for campus accounts and "title deeds" for iPads. Without this portal, the school wouldn't have a way to prove they own their hardware or distribute paid curriculum software officially to student devices.
