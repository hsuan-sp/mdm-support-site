## Definition

Activation Lock is an Apple security feature designed to prevent unauthorized use of a lost or stolen device. It is automatically enabled when "Find My" is turned on. Once a device is reset, the original user's Apple ID and password are required to reactivate it. While effective for anti-theft, it can be a challenge for schools if a student or staff member leaves without signing out. Administrators must use an **Activation Lock Bypass Code** from their MDM to unlock and reuse the hardware.

## Plain English

Think of this as the device's "Anti-Theft Deadbolt." Even if a thief completely wipes the iPad, they will be greeted by a lock screen requiring your password. It makes the device useless to anyone but the rightful owner. However, it can become a "Zombie Device" if a student graduates and forgets to unlock it—leaving the school with a piece of hardware that can't be reused without an IT "Override Key."
