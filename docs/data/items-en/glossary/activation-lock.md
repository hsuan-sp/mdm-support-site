# Term Definition
Activation Lock is a security feature designed to prevent anyone else from using an iPad, Mac, or iPhone if it's ever lost or stolen. It requires the user’s Managed Apple Account or a school-managed "Bypass Code" to erase or reactivate the device.

# Analogy
Activation Lock is like a **"Biometric Safe"** for your hardware. If someone picks up a lost school iPad and tries to factory reset it to make it their own, the device will "lock down" and demand the school’s master key. Without that key, the device is essentially a high-tech paperweight, making it useless to thieves.
