## Definition

Guided Access is a built-in accessibility and classroom management feature for iOS and iPadOS. It allows a user to "lock" the device into a single app and control which features (such as the Home button or specific screen areas) are available. Teachers use Guided Access to keep students focused during assessments or to turn an iPad into a dedicated learning station for a specific task.

## Plain English

This is the "Single-App Lock Mode." For example, before handing out an iPad for an exam, a teacher can triple-click a button to lock the student into the testing app. The student won't be able to press the home button to leave the test or switch to a game until the teacher enters a secret passcode. It’s a great way to help students stay 100% focused on their current work.
