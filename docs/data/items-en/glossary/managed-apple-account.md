## Term Definition

A Managed Apple Account (formerly Managed Apple ID) is an institutional account created via ASM. Unlike personal Apple IDs, these accounts are owned and controlled by the school. They provide access to 200GB of iCloud storage and collaboration tools but exclude features like purchasing on the App Store or using Apple Pay.

## Analogy

A Managed Apple Account is a **"Campus Access Card."** It’s the key students use to log into school resources, collaborate on documents, and use Apple Classroom. Just like a physical campus card, the school has the master key—they can reset the password if a student forgets it, and the data stored there is considered a "school record" rather than a private personal one.
