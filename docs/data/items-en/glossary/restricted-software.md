## Definition

Restricted Software is a "Blocklist" mechanism within Jamf Pro. Administrators can define a list of prohibited applications (such as unauthorized games or older macOS installers). If a user attempts to open a restricted app, the system immediately forces the application to quit and can be configured to delete the app and display a warning message to the user.

## Plain English

Think of this as the school's "Digital Hall Monitor." The hall monitor is always watching; if they catch you trying to use a "prohibited item" (like a game during class), they will immediately take it away and give you a warning. It helps keep everyone focused on learning instead of playing unapproved games.
