## Definition

In a management context, Inventory refers to the detailed database of all organizational hardware and software assets. Each device entry in the inventory includes extensive data points such as the serial number, IP address, OS version, disk usage, and assigned user. This centralized record is essential for IT teams to perform security audits, plan for hardware refreshes, and troubleshoot individual student iPad issues.

## Plain English

This is the "Central Asset Registry." Just as the school library has a list of every book it owns and who has borrowed them, the IT inventory is a centralized record of every iPad and Mac in the school. It tells IT exactly where each device is, how old it is, and what's currently happening with its "health," making it much easier to support students.
