## Term Definition

**Shared iPad** is a multi-user enrollment mode for iPadOS designed for classroom carts.

How it works:

* **Cloud Storage**: Users sign in with their Managed Apple Account. Their personal data is downloaded from iCloud to the device.

* **Caching**: The iPad caches the data locally for the most recent users (e.g., last 5 students) so they can log in instantly next time.

* **Privacy**: Each user's data is encrypted separately. Student A cannot see Student B's photos or files.

* **Guest Mode**: Allows temporary usage without a login for quick research tasks.

## Analogy

Shared iPad is like a **"Library Computer Terminal"** but for tablets.

Many different students sit at the computer throughout the week. When you log in with your ID, your specific folders and desktop background appear.

When you log off, the computer resets for the next student, but all your hard work is safely **"on the server"** (iCloud) waiting for your next visit.
