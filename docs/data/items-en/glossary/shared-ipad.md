# Term Definition
Shared iPad is a technology that allows multiple students to use the same iPad while having their own unique experience. When a student logs in with their Managed Apple Account, their data (like photos and documents) is downloaded from iCloud. When they log out, the data is pushed back to the cloud, allowing the next student to use a clean device.

# Analogy
Shared iPad is like a **"Library Computer Terminal."** Many different students sit at the computer throughout the week. When you log in with your personal ID, your specific folders and desktop background appear. When you’re done and log off, the computer resets for the next student, but all your hard work is safely "on the server" (iCloud) waiting for your next visit.
