## Definition

An Enrollment Invitation is a manual method for adding devices to the Jamf management system. An administrator generates a unique URL or QR code and sends it to a user. When the user clicks the link or scans the code on their device, they are guided through the process of installing the management profile. This is commonly used in BYOD scenarios for personal iPhones or Macs.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Digital Golden Ticket." The school sends you a special link; once you click it, your personal device is "invited" into the school's management system. This allows you to get school Wi-Fi and apps automatically, but because it's an invitation you accepted, the school still can't see your personal photos or messages.
