# Term Definition
A Passcode Policy is a set of rules enforced by the school to ensure devices are protected by a strong password. This can include requirements for minimum length, complexity (alphanumeric), and how often the password must be changed.

# Analogy
A Passcode Policy is like **"Setting the Standards for Classroom Keys."** Instead of letting students use a simple locker lock that everyone can guess, the school requires a more sophisticated key. This ensures that if a device is left on the school bus, the important school records inside remain locked up tight.
