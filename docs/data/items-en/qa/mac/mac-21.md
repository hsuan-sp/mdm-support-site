## Q: macOS 26 Transparency: Students can see MDM privacy settings. How do I handle questions?

## Answer

**macOS 26 explicitly labels privacy permissions (Camera, Mic, Screen Recording) that are managed by the organization in System Settings.**

## The Interface Change:

* **Pre-macOS 26**: Users saw toggles as grayed out but often didn't know *why*.

* **macOS 26**: Displays a badge: **"Managed by [School Name]"**. Users can see what has been authorized but cannot change it.

## How to Respond to Common Student/Staff Questions:

* **"Why is the Microphone forced ON?"**

  * Response: This ensures apps like Zoom, Google Meet, or recording software for language classes work instantly. Being "Authorized" does not mean it is "Recording"—macOS still shows a hardware-level **Orange Light** whenever the mic is active.

  * **"Why is the Screen Recording permission managed?"**

  * Response: This allows students to share their screen during a presentation or remote lab. macOS displays a **Purple icon** in the menu bar whenever a screen is being shared or recorded.

  * **"Why can't I turn it OFF?"**

  * Response: Managing these via MDM ensures that critical educational tools don't fail due to a student accidentally clicking "Deny." This reduces technical downtime in the classroom.

## Professional Advice:

Be transparent. Acknowledge that privacy concerns are valid, and explain that these MDM profiles (PPPC) are there to *enable* functionality, not to monitor private behavior. macOS's physical hardware indicators (lights) remain the ultimate source of truth for the user.
