## Q: How do I prevent students from entering Recovery Mode to format the computer?

## Answer

**The protection mechanism differs depending on the Mac architecture: Intel-based Macs require a 'Firmware Password,' while Apple Silicon (M-series) Macs require a 'Recovery Lock.' Both can be deployed via Jamf Pro.**

Recovery Mode is powerful. If left unprotected, anyone with physical access can "Erase Disk" or "Reinstall OS" to bypass school management.

## Comparison of Mechanisms:

| Architecture | Protection Mechanism | Deployment Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Apple Silicon (M1-M5)** | **Recovery Lock** | Configured via **MDM Remote Command** only |
| **Intel Mac** | **Firmware Password** | Configured via **Configuration Profile** or Command |

## 1. Recovery Lock (For Apple Silicon)

Starting with macOS 11.5, MDM can set a Recovery Lock. When enabled, the Mac will prompt for the administrator-defined password before allowing entry into Recovery Mode.

* **Jamf Pro Action**: Select a computer > **Management > Remote Commands > Set Recovery Lock**.

* **Management Note**: Jamf Pro will escrow the password so you can retrieve it later from the inventory record.

## 2. Firmware Password (For Intel Macs)

This prevents the Mac from booting from anything other than the designated startup disk without a password.

* **Jamf Pro Action**: Create a **Computer Configuration Profile** with the **EFI Password** payload.

## Practical Advice:

Setting these locks is a fundamental security requirement for shared labs or student 1:1 laptops. Without them, "Remote Management" can be circumvented via a hard reset and disk wipe in the Recovery environment.
