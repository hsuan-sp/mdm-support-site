## Q: How do we distribute non-App Store software like Chrome, Adobe CC, or Office?

## Answer

**Move away from manual packaging. Use Jamf Pro's "App Installers" for high-frequency apps, and DDM-based distribution for mission-critical software.**

Managing Mac software used to involve a tedious cycle of downloading DMGs, repackaging them into PKGs, and uploading them. Today, there are much more efficient pathways.

## Modern Software Deployment Tiers:

* **Tier 1: Jamf App Installers (Preferred)**:
  * **The Workflow**: You choose "Google Chrome" from the Jamf catalog. Jamf handles the downloading, packaging, and—crucially—the **Automatic Updates**.
  * **Self-Healing**: In **macOS 26**, this is backed by DDM. If a student deletes Chrome, the Mac notices the "State Desync" and automatically reinstalls the app in the background without any IT intervention.
* **Tier 2: Mac App Store (VPP)**:
  * Best for classroom favorites like Goodnotes, Keynote, or GarageBand.
  * Purchase licenses in bulk via Apple School Manager and push them to devices. Installation is silent and updates are managed by the system.
* **Tier 3: Adobe Creative Cloud (Shared Device License)**:
  * For computer labs, use the **Adobe Admin Console** to create a "Shared Device License" package.
  * Push this package via a Jamf Pro policy. This ensures that any student who sits at the Mac can use the software using their individual school ID.
* **Tier 4: Custom PKGs (Last Resort)**:
  * Use **Jamf Composer** to package specialized local curriculum software or niche drivers that are not found in public catalogs.

## Institutional Advice:

Focus on the **"App Installers"** catalog for 90% of your needs. Ensuring that apps like Chrome and Zoom are automatically kept on the latest version is the single best way to reduce security vulnerabilities across the campus.
