## Q: How can I quickly reset (wipe) a Mac lab, similar to using recovery cards?

## Answer

**In the era of Apple Silicon (M-series), using "recovery cards" or "Ghost" imaging is no longer recommended and often not even possible. Instead, use the "Erase All Content and Settings (EACS)" command.**

Traditional monolithic imaging has been completely retired by Apple. The modern reset logic is "Clear user data + Keep operating system + Automatically re-enroll."

## Comparison of Methods:

| Feature | Legacy Re-imaging | Erase All Content and Settings (EACS) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Principle** | Format drive > Re-download & install OS | Destroy encryption keys > Clear user data |
| **Time Required** | 1-2 hours | **5-10 minutes** |
| **Network Demand** | Requires 12GB+ OS download | **Minimal bandwidth** |
| **Data Security** | Disk formatting (recoverable) | Cryptographic destruction (unrecoverable) |
| **Hardware** | All Intel/Apple Silicon Macs | Macs with T2 or Apple Silicon chips |

## Standard Reset SOP (Jamf Pro):

1. **Send Command**:

* Send the **"Wipe Computer"** command to the target computer group.

  * **Crucial**: For Apple Silicon and T2-equipped Macs, this command triggers **EACS (Erase All Content and Settings)**.

1. **Execution (Within minutes)**:

* The system instantly discards the encryption keys (Cryptographic Erase), making data unreadable within seconds.

  * The computer reboots to the "Hello" screen.

1. **Automated Deployment (Zero-Touch)**:

* The computer connects to the network (Ensure a non-authenticated Wi-Fi or wired network is provided).

  * **ADE (Automated Device Enrollment)** is triggered automatically.

  * The **PreStage Enrollment** settings are downloaded from Jamf Pro.

  * Administrator accounts are created, software is installed, and settings are applied automatically.

## Difference from Traditional Recovery Cards:

* Traditional cards "restore on every reboot."

* Modern Mac management uses EACS reset at the "end of a semester or project."

If daily restoration is required (e.g., for library public kiosks), consider using **"Guest User"** mode (which deletes data upon logout) or specialized kiosk software (like Deep Freeze for Mac, though check compatibility with modern macOS).
