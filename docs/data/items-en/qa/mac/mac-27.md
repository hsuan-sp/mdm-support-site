## Q: Automated Maintenance: Using macOS 26 DDM for 'Smart Energy Management' (Eco-friendly vs. Scheduled Updates).

## Answer

**In the past, school IT wanted computers ON for updates, while the facility manager wanted them OFF to save electricity. macOS 26 and DDM provide a perfect automated balance.**

## 1. DDM Power Configuration Strategy (SOP)

Using macOS 26 **System Configurations**, you can set the following intelligent logic:

## Dynamic Sleep Schedule

* **School Hours**: Set a 20-minute idle-to-sleep timer for immediate student access.

* **Night Mode**: After 6:00 PM, transition to a deep sleep state (Power Nap).

## Update-Initiated Wake

* **Configuration**: Enable `Allow Wake for Managed Activity` in the DDM payload.

* **Effect**: Even if the Mac is asleep, when Jamf Pro pushes a **Security Response (RSR)** or a **DDM Software Declaration**, the Mac will briefly "wake," complete the background installation, and return to deep sleep once the task is reported as successful.

## Energy Auditing (Status Channel)

* You can monitor "Battery Cycle Counts" or "Up-time in High Performance Mode" via the DDM Status Channel to use as quantitative data for future hardware replacement cycles.

## 2. Operational Recommendations

* **Avoid Hard Power Cuts**: Discourage the facility team from cutting the main circuit to the lab at night. This prevents M4/M5 Macs from performing essential background maintenance tasks like AI indexing, Spotlight optimization, and system cache cleaning.

* **Nudge Integration**: If an update requires a restart, use a **Nudge** notification to ask the teacher to "Restart Now" the next morning, rather than forcing a midnight reboot that could cause loss of unsaved teaching materials.

## 3. Real-World Case Study

A school with 100 M5 Mac minis configured a "2:00 AM Power Nap" DDM window. These machines check for updates and security patches nightly. The average electricity cost increase per machine was less than $0.20 per month, yet 100% of the fleet remained on the latest secure version without a single man-hour of IT labor.

Declaring your energy policy via DDM allows the library and labs to be "Smarter, not just off," solving the long-standing conflict between IT maintenance and school energy savings.
