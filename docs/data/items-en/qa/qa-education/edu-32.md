## Q: What should I do if a student forgets their iPad passcode? Can a teacher help reset it?

## Answer

**Yes. As long as the iPad is managed by the school's MDM (Jamf Pro) and remains connected to the internet, a teacher or IT administrator can "Clear Passcode" remotely without needing to wipe the device.**

This is a very common scenario in the classroom.

## Method 1: Using Jamf Teacher (Recommended for Teachers)

If the school has deployed the Jamf Teacher app or web portal to teachers:

1. Open **Jamf Teacher**.

1. Select the class where the student is located.

1. Select the student's name.

1. Find and tap the **"Clear Passcode"** option in the feature list.

1. The passcode on the student's iPad will be removed instantly. The student can then simply swipe to open the device and set a new passcode.

## Method 2: Using the Jamf Pro Console (For Administrators)

1. Log in to the Jamf Pro dashboard and search for the iPad.

1. Go to **`Inventory` > `Management` > `Commands`**.

1. Click the **`Clear Passcode`** command.

1. As long as the device is connected to the network, the passcode lock will disappear moments later.

## ⚠️ Important Considerations:

* **Network Connection is Required**: If the iPad is locked out as "iPad Unavailable" because too many incorrect passcodes were entered, and **Wi-Fi has disconnected**, the command cannot be delivered. In this case, the device might need to be restored via a computer.

* **Different from Apple ID Password**: This method only removes the "Screen Lock Passcode." It does not solve issues with forgetting an "Apple ID/iCloud password."

* **Preventive Measures**: Encourage students to use passcodes related to their class number or seat number, or keep a record on a sticker on the back of the iPad (though not ideal for security, it is practical for younger students).

**💡 Teacher Tip**:
In iOS 26, if a student enters an incorrect passcode 5 times, the iPad displays a "Connect to School Network" prompt. If it stays on Wi-Fi, a teacher's "Clear Passcode" command usually takes effect within 5 seconds, minimizing classroom disruption.
