## Q: Troubleshooting: A student used the same password for their iPad and Apple Account, and now both are locked.

## Answer

**This is a common 'Serial Lock' risk. If a student tries the wrong password too many times, both the device and the account may be locked out simultaneously.**

## Recovery SOP:

1. **Unlock the Device**: First, send the **Clear Passcode** command via Jamf Pro.
2. **Reset the Apple Account**: Administrator logs into **ASM**, selects the student account, and clicks **Reset Password**.
3. **Education**: Advise the student that their 6-digit iPad pin and their Apple Account password should be different to prevent total lockouts in the future.
