## Q: How do students submit their work (Keynote/Pages) to the teacher?

## Answer

**The best method is via cloud storage (Google Drive, OneDrive, or iCloud Drive). Other options include AirDrop, Google Classroom assignments, or a school-designated submission portal.**

In a digital learning environment, a smooth submission flow is key to efficiency.

## Method 1: Google Drive (Highly Recommended)

Ideal for schools already using Google Workspace for Education.

1. Ensure **Google Drive** and relevant apps (Docs/Slides) are installed.

1. In Keynote/Pages, tap **Share** (the share icon).

1. Select **Save to Files**.

1. In the Files app, select **Google Drive** (Enable it via the "..." menu if it doesn't appear).

1. Save to the folder designated by the teacher.

## Method 2: Google Classroom Assignments

If the teacher has created an "Assignment" in Classroom:

1. Open the Classroom app and tap the assignment.

1. Tap **Add Attachment**.

1. Select the file from the **Files** app.

1. Tap **Hand In**.

## Method 3: AirDrop (In-person)

Best for small groups or immediate collection.

1. Open the project and tap **Share**.

1. Select **AirDrop**.

1. Tap the teacher's iPad name.

**Pros**: Fast, works without internet. **Cons**: Noisy in large groups; files must be accepted one by one.

## Recommended Export Formats:

| Goal | Recommended Format |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Retain Editing** | Native format (.key, .pages) or Microsoft (.pptx, .docx) |
| **Read/Print Only** | PDF |
| **Video Project** | Movie (.mov) |

## Troubleshooting:

* **Cannot find Google Drive in Files app**: Open the **Files** app > Tap "..." > **Edit** > Toggle on **Google Drive**.

* **File too large**: Lower video resolution or share via a cloud link instead.
