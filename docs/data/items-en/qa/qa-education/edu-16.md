## Q: Why can't iPads install 'APKs' (or third-party apps) like Android devices?

## Answer

**To ensure device security and stability, Apple restricts app installation to the App Store or trusted organizational MDM channels (preventing 'Sideloading').**

## Rationale:

* **Malware Prevention**: Third-party installation files (IPA) can contain trojans or keyloggers.

* **System Stability**: Unvetted apps can cause battery drain, system crashes, or data leaks.

* **Auditing**: School-issued devices must maintain authorized license counts and updates; manual sideloading makes asset management impossible.

## Practical Advice:

If an app is needed for teaching, please submit a request to the IT Coordinator. Once vetted for security, it will be purchased via VPP and deployed to your device automatically.
