## Q: How do teachers manage Apple Intelligence 'Writing Tools' in the classroom?

## Answer

**Apple Intelligence's 'Writing Tools' are powerful assistants, but they raise concerns about academic integrity during composition or language exams. Teachers can manage these through MDM restrictions or real-time monitoring via the Classroom app.**

## Three Management Strategies

## 1. Administrative Restrictions via MDM (Mandatory)

IT administrators can configure specific restrictions in the Jamf Pro profile:

* **Full Disable**: Best for high-stakes exam periods.

* **Granular Block**: Schools can choose to disable the "Rewrite" feature (preventing AI from writing the essay) while allowing the "Proofread" and "Summarize" features for daily learning support.

* **Managed Apple Account Compliance**: On school-managed devices, Writing Tools data is processed with strict privacy protocols, ensuring student data is never used for model training.

## 2. Real-time Monitoring via 'Classroom' App

iOS 26 enhances a teacher’s visibility into the student's activity:

* **Screen View**: Teachers can see in real-time if a student has the Writing Tools floating panel open on their screen.

* **Class Summary**: After a session ends, the "Class Summary" report can indicate which students utilized AI assistance during their writing time.

## 3. Utilizing Assessment Mode

For formal testing, we recommend using **'Single App Mode'**. In iOS 26, entering Single App Mode **automatically suppresses** system-level Apple Intelligence features, ensuring a clean and fair testing environment.

## Pedagogical Recommendations

* **Transparency**: If AI tools are permitted, require students to add a disclosure note at the end of their work (e.g., "This essay was proofread using Apple Intelligence").

* **AI as a teaching tool**: Use the multiple "Rewrite" versions generated by AI as a starting point for class discussions on rhetoric and tone.

## Summary

AI is a critical future skill. Rather than a permanent ban, we recommend teachers allow AI during the "Brainstorming" phase while restricting it via MDM during the "Formal Drafting" and "Assessment" phases.
