## Q: I heard MDM drains the battery quickly. Is this true?

## Answer

**This is a myth. MDM itself consumes very little resources and does not significantly impact battery life. The real battery drainers are typically screen brightness, video streaming, and GPS navigation.**

Actually, MDM operates in an extremely energy-efficient way.

* **Declarative Management (DDM)**: **2026 Mainstream Tech**. Devices now monitor their own state (e.g., whether a profile is active) and only report to the server when a "change" occurs. This drastically reduces the power loss associated with traditional MDM "polling."

* **No Persistent Connection**: MDM does not need to maintain a continuous network connection or VPN tunnel.

## Jamf Trust Power Consumption:

The Jamf Trust app, which handles content filtering and data reporting, also uses very little power:

* It uses DNS Proxy technology at the system level.

* Background processes are highly optimized.

* Under **Settings > Battery**, Jamf Trust typically accounts for less than 1% of usage.

## The Real Battery Killers:

| Factor | Impact | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Max Screen Brightness** | ⚡⚡⚡ Very High | Lower brightness to 50% or enable "Auto-Brightness." |
| **Long Video Streaming (YouTube, Netflix)** | ⚡⚡⚡ Very High | Limit usage time. |
| **GPS Navigation Apps** | ⚡⚡⚡ Very High | Close when not in use. |
| **Background App Refresh** | ⚡⚡ Medium | Disable in **Settings > General > Background App Refresh**. |
| **Email Push** | ⚡ Low | Change to "Fetch" mode. |
| **AirDrop Searching** | ⚡ Low | Set to "Contacts Only" or "Off." |

## How to Check Battery Usage:

1. Go to **Settings > Battery**.

1. View usage for the "Last 24 Hours" or "Last 10 Days."

1. Identify which apps are consuming the most power.

1. If Jamf Trust or "MDM" exceeds 5%, contact your administrator.

## Practical Advice: Battery Health

If a device is several years old and doesn't last as long as it used to, it is likely due to battery aging. You can check battery cycle counts and health via Jamf Pro to evaluate if a replacement is needed.
