# Q: The system prompted to agree to 'New Terms and Conditions' when logging into Apple School Manager (ASM). Is this important?

# Answer

**Yes, this is extremely important and should be prioritized immediately.**

When Apple updates its service terms, a "Terms and Conditions" window will pop up when you log into [Apple School Manager (ASM)](https://school.apple.com). Ignoring this will impact several critical management functions.

### The Impact of Not Agreeing

* **Registration Blocked**: New devices will fail the **Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)** process. Apple’s servers will reject registration requests from your organization until the terms are accepted.
* **VPP Sync Interruption**: The synchronization of **Volume Purchase Program (VPP)** content will pause. You will be unable to assign new apps or book licenses to your devices.
* **Feature Lockout**: You may lose access to newer administrative features, such as **Apple Intelligence controls** or the ability to view **AppleCare coverage** within your MDM dashboard.
* **Management Delays**: While currently enrolled devices won't stop working, you won't be able to push any new configuration profiles or app updates to them.

### Who Can Accept the Terms?

Only users with the **"Administrator"** role in ASM have the authority to accept these terms. Users with "Content Manager" or "Site Manager" roles will see the notice but will not be able to clear it.

### Practical Steps
1.  Log in to [school.apple.com](https://school.apple.com) using your Administrator account.
2.  Follow the prompts in the banner or popup window.
3.  Read the terms, check the "I have read and agree..." boxes, and click **"Agree."**

### Institutional Advice:
We recommend that every school has at least **two separate Administrator accounts** (e.g., the ICT Director and a designated systems administrator). This ensures that if one person is unavailable or leaves the school, global management of your Apple fleet can continue without interruption.
