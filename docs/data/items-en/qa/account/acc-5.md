## Q: My school uses Google Workspace / Microsoft 365. Can we use these IDs to sign into Apple services?

## Answer

**Yes. This is called "Federated Authentication," and it allows students and staff to use their existing school credentials to create and sign into Managed Apple Accounts.**

By linking Apple School Manager (ASM) with your Google Workspace or Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), you create a seamless "Single Sign-On" experience across all campus devices.

## Key Benefits:

* **One Password**: Users don't need to remember a separate password for their iPad or Mac. They use their official campus login.
* **Automatic Provisioning**: You can configure a **SCIM** bridge so that when a new student is added to Google or Microsoft, their Apple account is created automatically in ASM—no CSV imports required.
* **Security Alignment**: Password policies and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) are managed by your primary identity provider (Google or Microsoft).

## Technical Requirements:

1. **Domain Verification**: You must prove ownership of your school's email domain (e.g., `@tes.tp.edu.tw`) within ASM by adding a specific TXT record to your DNS settings.
2. **IdP Connection**: An administrator must authorize the link within the ASM **Preferences > Directory Sync** section.
3. **Conflict Resolution**: If staff members have previously used their school email to create *personal* Apple IDs, Apple will provide a 60-day window for them to change their personal email address to a private one before the school "takes over" that domain.

## Operational Note:

VitePress and Jamf Pro fully support this through **Platform SSO** on macOS. When a teacher logs into their Mac for the first time, they simply use their Microsoft or Google credentials, and the system handles the rest. This drastically reduces the number of "I can't log in" tickets for the ICT team.
