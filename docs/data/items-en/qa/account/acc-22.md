## Q: How do I batch create Managed Apple Accounts? Should I use SFTP or CSV import?

## Answer

**According to official Apple documentation, there are three primary ways to create Managed Apple Accounts: SFTP Upload (SIS integration), Manual CSV Import, and Federated Authentication.**

## Comparison of Methods

| Method | Best For | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Manual CSV Import** | Small schools, no SIS, or temporary batches | Straightforward web-based upload. Good for initial setup. |
| **SFTP Upload** | Schools with a SIS, requiring regular updates | Supports Apple templates and OneRoster. Highly automated. |
| **Federated Authentication** | Schools using Google Workspace / Entra ID | **Most Recommended**. Automatic account creation upon first login. |

## 1. Uploading Data via SFTP (Automation/SIS Integration)

If your school uses a Student Information System (SIS), you can upload data via Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).

* **Supported Formats**:
  * **Apple CSV Format**: Using standard Apple-provided templates.
  * **OneRoster CSV**: Supporting OneRoster version 1.1 specifications.
  * **Workflow**:

1. **Setup Connection**: Obtain your SFTP URL, username, and password from ASM.
2. **Prepare Files**: Export data and create a **ZIP archive** containing all necessary CSV files.
3. **Upload**: Use an SFTP client to connect and drag the ZIP file into the **dropbox** folder (this is the default root folder on Apple’s SFTP server).
4. **Processing**: ASM will process the files automatically. You can download logs to check for errors.

*Note: After the initial connection, every subsequent update must include "all" CSV files, even those that haven't changed.*

## 2. Manual CSV Upload

Ideal for scenarios without an SFTP server, performed directly via the browser.

* **Path**: Log in to ASM > Select CSV options in the sidebar > "Upload CSV."
* **Process**: Choose your format (Apple or OneRoster) > Upload files > System validates and imports.

## 3. Federated Authentication (with Directory Sync)

This is the most modern approach, linking ASM to **Google Workspace** or **Microsoft Entra ID**.

* **Advantage**: Users log in with their existing organizational Email and password to create their Managed Apple Account on the fly.
* **Hybrid Mode**: You can use Federated Authentication for identity and SFTP for roster data (classes). This perfectly combines existing identity providers with curriculum data.

## Expert Advice

* **Person ID is Key**: Regardless of the method, the `person_id` must be a **permanently unique** identifier. We strongly recommend using a Student ID number rather than a classroom seat number, as the latter changes every year and will cause account duplicates or data corruption.
