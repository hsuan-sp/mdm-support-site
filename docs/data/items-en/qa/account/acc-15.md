## Q: What are the main differences between Jamf Pro and Jamf School? How should we choose?

## Answer

**Both products are Apple-validated MDM solutions, but they differ significantly in design philosophy, language support, and depth of management capabilities.**

Based on official technical specifications, here is an objective comparison:

## 1. User Interface and Localization

* **Jamf Pro**: Offers full, official **Traditional Chinese** localization, making it more accessible for local technical staff and administrators.

* **Jamf School**: As of late 2025, the administrative interface **is not available in Traditional Chinese**, supporting only English and several European languages.

## 2. Management Logic and Technical Depth

* **Jamf Pro**: Utilizes a "Smart Groups" and "Policies" mechanism. Beyond standard configuration profiles, it supports extensive custom **Scripts** and **Extension Attributes**, allowing for granular, low-level automation and management.

* **Jamf School**: Designed specifically for K-12 environments with a simplified, intuitive interface. While it includes smart groups, its core focus is on the deployment of configuration profiles; its ability to execute low-level scripts is more limited compared to Jamf Pro.

## 3. Multi-Site Architecture and Scalability

* **Jamf Pro**: Features a powerful **"Sites"** capability, allowing for completely independent management environments within a single server instance (e.g., a district managing the primary instance while individual schools manage their specific sites).

* **Jamf School**: While it supports multi-school management, the depth of isolation and permissioning for global resource sharing is more streamlined.

## 4. API and Third-Party Integration

* **Jamf Pro**: Boasts the most robust Classic and Pro APIs in the industry, enabling deep integration with external asset management systems, automated reporting tools, and identity providers.

* **Jamf School**: Provides an API, but the structure and available data fields are more concise than those of Jamf Pro.

## Practical Advice:

* **Choose Jamf Pro**: If your institution requires a **Traditional Chinese interface**, involves large-scale multi-site management, or needs complex automation scripts and deep third-party system integrations.

* **Choose Jamf School**: If your deployment scale is smaller, technical resources are limited, and your administrators are comfortable navigating an English-only interface.
