# Q: How do we balance automated app installs with limited school bandwidth?

# Answer

**During large-scale deployments (e.g., the first day of the school year), having hundreds of iPads simultaneously downloading the same apps can paralyze the campus network.**

To manage this, we recommend a "Tiered Deployment" strategy.

### Recommended Solutions:

*   **Implement Content Caching (Highly Recommended)**:
    *   Set up a dedicated Mac (connected via Ethernet) on your campus network and enable **"Content Caching"** in the System Settings.
    *   **The Result**: The first iPad downloads the app from the internet; the Mac saves a copy. The remaining 99 iPads then pull the app from that Mac over the high-speed local network, preserving your external internet bandwidth.
*   **Prioritize Essential vs. Optional Apps**:
    *   Configure only your core tools (e.g., MDM agents, browsers, LMS apps) as **"Auto-Install."**
    *   Place large, non-essential creative tools (e.g., GarageBand, iMovie, or heavy 3D titles) in **Self Service**. This allows students to download them gradually throughout the week as needed.
*   **Stagger the Enrollment**:
    *   Instead of letting an entire grade level unbox and enroll at the exact same minute, try staggering the classes by 30-minute intervals. This reduces the initial "burst" of traffic on your Wi-Fi access points.

### Operational Note:
If devices are showing a "Waiting" status during a major rollout, simply restarting the download in MDM often makes the problem worse by adding more requests to a choked network. Prioritizing **Content Caching** is the single most effective way to solve bandwidth fatigue.
