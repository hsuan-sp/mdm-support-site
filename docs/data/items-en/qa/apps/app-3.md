## Q: If the App Store is hidden, how can students get the apps they need for class?

## Answer

**Even when the official App Store is disabled via a management profile, students can still safely acquire apps through the "Self Service" app.**

## The Role of Self Service:

Self Service is the school’s private, curated app portal. Instead of giving students access to the millions of apps on the public App Store, IT "publishes" specific, pre-approved titles into Self Service.

## Why this is the preferred setup:

1. **Safety & Focus**: It prevents students from downloading non-educational games, social media, or inappropriate content.
2. **Bandwidth & Storage Efficiency**: Instead of forcing 50 large apps onto every iPad (which uses up storage and slows down the network), IT can make them "Optional." Students only download the specific tools required for their current project.
3. **Independence**: Students can reinstall apps or trigger manual updates for their school tools without needing to ask an ICT administrator for a password.

## Troubleshooting:

* **Missing Self Service**: If the app is missing, ensure the device is correctly enrolled and has a stable Wi-Fi connection.
* **Web Clips**: The school can also place direct links to web-based platforms (like ManageBac or Google Classroom) inside Self Service for easy one-tap access.
