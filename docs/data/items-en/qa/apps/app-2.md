# Q: Can we install apps on iPads without signing into an Apple ID?

# Answer

**Yes. This is called "Device-based Assignment," and it is the standard and most efficient method for school environments.**

By using the **Volume Purchase Program (VPP)** within Apple School Manager (ASM), the school links app licenses to the device’s **Serial Number** rather than a specific student’s Apple ID.

### Advantages for the School:
*   **Zero-Login Deployment**: Students can receive all necessary classroom apps immediately upon unboxing the device without ever needing a personal or Managed Apple Account.
*   **Asset Reclamation**: App licenses remain school property. When a student graduates or an iPad is erased, the license is automatically "returned" to your school’s pool, ready to be redistributed to another device.
*   **Simplified Maintenance**: There are no prompts for passwords when apps need to be updated or reinstalled.

### Important Limitation: In-App Purchases
Since the device is not signed into a personal account, **In-App Purchases (IAP) are not supported** in this mode. If your curriculum requires premium features within an app, we strongly recommend choosing apps that offer a "Pro" or "Full" version available as a one-time VPP purchase.

### Technical Requirement:
In the Jamf Pro App settings, ensure the **"Assign VPP Content"** checkbox is selected and the distribution method is set to **"Install Automatically/Prompt users to install."**
