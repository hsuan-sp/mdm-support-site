# Q: Apps on the iPad are stuck on 'Waiting' or failing to install. How do I troubleshoot this?

# Answer

**A 'Waiting' status usually indicates that the installation process is stalled at either the 'License Verification' or the 'Download Queue' stage.**

When an MDM sends an installation command, a complex handshake occurs between the device and Apple’s servers. Please check these common failure points:

### Common Causes & Solutions:

1.  **Insufficient VPP Licenses (Most Common)**:
    *   **Check**: Log in to Jamf Pro and verify the license count for that app.
    *   **Solution**: If **Used Count = Total Count**, Apple's servers will reject the download request. Go to Apple School Manager (ASM) and acquire more licenses. *Tip: For free apps, always "purchase" a large quantity (e.g., 5,000) to account for future growth.*
2.  **Campus Network Restrictions**:
    *   App downloads require access to Apple’s **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**. If your school’s firewall blocks these domains, the download will sit at 0%.
    *   **Test**: Connect the iPad to a mobile hotspot. If the progress bar starts moving immediately, the issue lies with your campus network configuration.
3.  **Assignment Mode Conflict**:
    *   Ensure the app is set to **"Device-based Assignment"** in Jamf Pro. If it’s incorrectly set to "User-based," the device will wait indefinitely for a student to log into a personal Apple ID.
4.  **Declarative Management (DDM) Desync**:
    *   In the latest iPadOS versions, app status is reported via DDM. If the status seems "stuck" in the dashboard, try sending a **"Cancel All Pending Commands"** followed by an **"Update Inventory"** command to the device.
5.  **Storage Constraints**:
    *   If the iPad’s storage is nearly full, the OS will automatically pause background downloads. Check **Settings > General > iPad Storage** to ensure enough overhead remains for the new apps.
