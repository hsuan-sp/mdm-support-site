## Q: Why does the iPad prompt for an Apple ID password when opening an app?

## Answer

**This usually happens because the "License Source" does not match the "Installation Identity," causing the system to attempt to verify the original purchaser's ID.**

On managed iPads, these prompts typically stem from three types of technical conflicts:

## Cause 1: Personal vs. Organizational License Conflict (Most Common)

* **Scenario**: A student previously downloaded the app using a **Personal Apple Account** (e.g., YouTube), and the administrator later tried to deploy the same app via MDM.

* **Logic**: Even if the app name is the same, the system knows it was originally acquired by a personal account. If the MDM fails to successfully "Take Over" the app as a **Managed App**, the system will keep asking for the personal password used for the original purchase.

* **Solution**: **"Delete and Redeploy."** Manually delete the app from the iPad and have the administrator re-send the install command via Jamf Pro. This ensures the app is reinstalled using a "Device-based" license.

## Cause 2: Incorrect Assignment Mode

* **Scenario**: The admin configured the app distribution in Jamf Pro using **"User-based Assignment"** instead of "Device-based."

* **Logic**: This mode requires an Apple ID to "hold" the license. If the device is not signed in or the signed-in ID doesn't match the assigned user, a login prompt appears.

* **Solution**: Edit the app settings in Jamf Pro and change the distribution method to **"Device-based Assignment"** (select "Assign VPP Content" and scope to devices or device groups).

## Cause 3: VPP License Handshake Failure

* **Scenario**: The command was sent, but the Apple VPP server has not yet completed the license registration for that specific serial number.

* **Logic**: The device has downloaded the app but cannot find a valid device-based license token during its initial check, so it defaults to asking the user to sign in for verification.

* **Solution**: Wait a few minutes or send a **"Blank Push"** to the device from Jamf Pro to force the device to re-verify its licensing status with Apple servers.

## Practical Advice:

On shared school devices, always strictly enforce **Device-based Assignment**. If a single device keeps prompting for a password, the most efficient fix is to delete the app and redownload it via **Self Service**, which re-establishes the correct licensing link.
