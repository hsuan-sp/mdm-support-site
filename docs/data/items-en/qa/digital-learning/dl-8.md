## Q: If school Wi-Fi is poor, can I connect the iPad to a wired network (Ethernet)?

## Answer

**Yes. Whether it's an older Lightning-based iPad or a newer USB-C model, they all support wired network connections via adapters.**

## Hardware Requirements & Choices:

## 1. Lightning Models (e.g., iPad 9th Gen)

* **Dedicated Adapter**: We recommend the **Belkin Ethernet + Power Adapter with Lightning Connector**.

* **Limitation**: Lightning ports have very limited power output. You **must** use an adapter with a charging port and connect a power source; otherwise, you will see a "device uses too much power" error.

## 2. USB-C Models (e.g., iPad 10th Gen, iPad Air, iPad Pro)

* **Universal USB-C to RJ45**: Standard USB-C network adapters are typically "plug-and-play."

* **Recommendation**: While an external power source isn't always required to drive the adapter, we still suggest using a **Hub with a PD charging port** to ensure the device stays charged during instruction.

## 3. RJ-45 Cable

Connect the adapter to the Ethernet wall jack in the classroom.

## Setup Steps:

1. Plug the adapter into the iPad.

1. **Crucial Step: Connect Power.** Plug the charging cable into the adapter's power port (especially for Lightning models).

1. Connect the Ethernet cable.

1. An **Ethernet** option will appear in the iPad **Settings**.

1. Check if the IP address is fetched correctly (usually via DHCP).

## Practical Advice:

* **Jamf Trust Support**: Protection and traffic tracking function normally over both Wi-Fi and Ethernet.

* **Priority**: When an Ethernet cable is connected, the iPad automatically prioritizes the wired connection, reducing the load on the Wi-Fi AP.

* **Firewall Rules**: Ensure the wired network VLAN also allows the necessary communication ports for Apple and Jamf services.
