## Q: MOE Jamf Pro accounts can't use 'Scheduled Updates'. How do I increase update success rates?

## Answer

**Because the MOE Jamf Pro environment uses 'legacy' update commands, the key to success is 'Verifying Connectivity' before sending the update.**

Many failures occur because devices are "unmanaged" (e.g., Wi-Fi disconnected or long-term sleep). Sending an OS update command to an unresponsive device is futile.

## Standard Operating Procedure (SOP):

## 1. Wake Devices and Update Inventory

Before sending a massive OS update, push an **Update Inventory** command to the group.

* **Goal**: Confirm the device is "alive" and get the latest **Battery Level** and **Available Space** data.

* **Tip**: If "Update Inventory" remains "Pending," the device is offline. Do not send the OS update yet; it needs to be physically unlocked and connected.

## 2. Filter Eligible Devices (Smart Group)

Use the fresh inventory data to filter for a "Ready to Update" group:

* **Battery > 50%**: (Apple hard-requirement; the command will fail below this).

* **Available Space > 10 GB**: To prevent download failures.

## 3. Send the Remote Command

* Use **Mass Actions > Send Remote Commands**.

* Select **Update OS version on supervised devices**.

* **Key Settings**:

  * Target Version: `Latest version based on device eligibility`.

  * Action: **`Download and install the update, and restart devices after installation`**. (If you only select 'Download', the update will never finish).

## 4. Batched Deployment

If the school lacks a **Content Caching** server, send updates in batches (e.g., one class at a time) to avoid crashing the school's external bandwidth.
