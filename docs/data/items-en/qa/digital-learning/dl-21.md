## Q: How should Digital Initiative iPads be managed after 2026? Should we keep the MDM?

## Answer

**Digital Initiative iPads are permanent school assets. We strongly recommend continuing to manage them via MDM to maintain device security, instructional quality, and asset integrity.**

## Why keep the MDM?

1. **Security**: Continued web filtering protects students from inappropriate content, and MDM-enforced restrictions prevent the installation of games or unauthorized apps.
2. **Instructional Continuity**: Maintain the ability to push apps, manage Wi-Fi settings, and support Apple Classroom.
3. **Asset Integrity**: MDM tracking helps locate misplaced devices and monitors battery health, ensuring the hardware lasts as long as possible.

## Recommended Strategies for 2026 and Beyond:

## 1. Unified Health Checks

* **Battery Health**: Identify units needing battery replacement before they become unusable.
* **OS Updates**: Evaluate if the entire fleet should move to **iOS 26**.
* **Audit**: Record physical damage and update the school’s overall asset registry.

## 2. Modernizing Use Case: Graduation and Rotation

When a student graduates and the device must be reassigned, use the **Return to Service (RTS)** feature. This is the fastest way to reset a device in **iOS 26**.

**The Return to Service Advantage**:

* **Secure Wipe**: Erasure of student data and browsing history.
* **App Preservation**: Unlike a traditional wipe, you can choose to keep the Managed Apps on the device. This saves 50–70% of the total reset time and significantly reduces network bandwidth strain.
* **Auto-Reconnect**: The device remembers its Wi-Fi settings and re-enrolls automatically.

| Feature | Traditional Wipe | Return to Service (iOS 26+) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wipe Data** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Keep Apps** | ❌ (Redownload needed) | ✅ (Ready immediately) |
| **Keep Network** | ❌ (Manual setup) | ✅ (Automatic) |
| **Time Reg.** | 30–60 Minutes | 5–15 Minutes |

## 3. Usage Flexibility

As the project's strict usage quotas subside, consider a more flexible "Teacher-Driven" model:

* **Flexible Checkout**: Use iPad trolleys for specific projects rather than fixed 1-to-1 assignments.
* **Quality over Quantity**: Encourage deep integration in relevant subjects rather than forcing daily use in every class.

## Technical Checklist for 2026:

* **Stay Online**: Keep devices connected to Wi-Fi so the MDM can push critical safety patches.
* **Backup Configs**: Export your current Jamf Pro XML/Configuration profiles as a backup.
* **Monitor unmanaged devices**: Use Smart Groups to catch devices that have been offline for over 60 days, as these are often tucked away in drawers and forgotten.
