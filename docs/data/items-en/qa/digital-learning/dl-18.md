## Q: A student forgot their iPad passcode. Do I have to factory reset the whole device?

## Answer

**No. MDM provides a 'Clear Passcode' command that removes the lock while 'Keeping All Data'.**

## Standard Rescue Steps (Jamf Pro):

1. **Verify Status**: Ensure the device is powered on and connected to the internet.

1. **Send Command**:

* In Jamf Pro, go to the device record.

  * Click **Management > Remote Commands > Clear Passcode**.

1. **Result**:

* Within 3-5 seconds, the iPad screen should flicker.

  * The passcode is removed. You can swipe to enter the Home Screen immediately.

  * *Note: Biometric data (Touch ID / Face ID) is also cleared and must be re-registered.*

## What if the iPad has no internet?

If the device is in Airplane Mode or the Wi-Fi is disconnected, the MDM command cannot reach it.

* **The Pro Move: Force Ethernet**:

  * **Lightning Models (iPad 9)**: Use a "Lightning to Ethernet Adapter" (must be connected to a power source).

  * **USB-C Models (iPad 10/Pro)**: Use a standard "USB-C to Ethernet Adapter."

  * **Action**: Plug the adapter into the locked iPad and connect a network cable. The iPad will automatically fetch an IP via DHCP. Once online, the "Clear Passcode" command waiting in the cloud will execute instantly, unlocking the device.

## Final Resort:

Only if Ethernet and Wi-Fi both fail should you perform a full DFU/Recovery mode reset.
