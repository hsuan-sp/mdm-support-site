## Q: How can I temporarily unblock certain websites needed for teaching?

## Answer

**Filtering rules for the Digital Learning Project are typically managed by higher-level authorities (Educational Bureaus). Modifying the blocklist is not recommended, but if an immediate exception is required for teaching, an "Exclusion" strategy is preferred.**

Depending on your specific needs, you can choose one of the following solutions:

## Method 1: Temporarily Exclude the Device (Jamf Trust Scope Exclusion)

1. Log in to Jamf Pro.
1. Navigate to the Jamf Trust **Configuration Profile (DNS Proxy / Content Filter)**.
1. Go to **Scope > Exclusions**.
1. Add the teacher's iPad or a specific class group to the exclusion list.
1. Once saved, the device will remove the filtering settings upon its next check-in, allowing access to sites like YouTube.
1. **Important**: Ensure you remove the exclusion after class. Otherwise, the device will permanently lack protection and data reporting.

## Method 2: AirPlay via Teacher Device

* If students only need to "view" content rather than "interact" with it, it is recommended that the teacher play the video on their own device (which typically has less restrictive filtering) and project it to the classroom Apple TV via AirPlay.

## Practical Advice: Risk Management

* **Data Interruption**: Once a device is excluded from the Jamf Trust scope, **traffic data reporting stops completely.** Avoid long-term exclusions for student devices, as this will affect the school's usage rate KPIs.
* **Content Control**: Once unblocked, students can access all websites (including inappropriate content). Teachers must closely monitor student activity during this time.
