## Q: How do I set a unify school wallpaper and prevent students from changing it?

## Answer

**This is a common requirement for asset branding. We recommend using 'Automated Management' to set the image and 'Restrictions' to lock the permission.**

## Implementation Steps (Jamf Pro):

## 1. Method 1: Automated Management (Recommended)

* **Scenario**: The wallpaper is set automatically the moment a device is assigned to a group (e.g., "Freshmen iPads").

* **Path**: Go to a **Smart Device Group > Automated Management** tab.

* **Setting**: Click **Set Wallpaper**.

* **Upload**: Upload your school logo/wallpaper (JPG/PNG). Apply it to both the "Lock Screen" and "Home Screen."

## 2. Method 2: Manual Mass Action

* **Scenario**: Setting a one-time wallpaper for a school anniversary or event.

* **Path**: In the group view, click **Action > Send Remote Commands > Set Wallpaper**.

## 3. Critical Step: Lock Modification

* **Path**: In a **Restrictions** profile > **Functionality**.

* **Setting**: Uncheck **Allow modifying wallpaper**.

* **Effect**: The "Wallpaper" option in the iPad Settings menu will be grayed out, preventing students from changing it.

## 4. Advanced: Lock Screen Message

Instead of editing every image, use the **Lock Screen Message** payload.

* **Setting**: Use Jamf variables like `Owned by: $DEVICENAME` or `Asset: $ASSET_TAG`.

* **Effect**: This dynamic text appears at the bottom of the Lock Screen, making physical audits much easier.
