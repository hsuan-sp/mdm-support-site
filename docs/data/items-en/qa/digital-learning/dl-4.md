## Q: How do I create Smart Groups specifically for tracking different phases of our hardware rollout?

## Answer

**Smart Groups are the "sorting bins" of Jamf Pro. They allow you to automatically categorize devices based on their purchase year, model, or health status.**

Using Smart Groups, you can target specific "batches" of hardware with unique apps or restrictions without having to manually select each iPad.

## Common Logic Examples:

1. **Based on Naming Conventions (Recommended)**:

* If you named your new arrivals with a year prefix (e.g., `2025-iPad-001`).
* **Criterion**: Device Name **like** `2025-%`.
* **Result**: All devices from the 2025 intake are instantly grouped for easy management.

1. **Based on Asset Tags**:

* If you uploaded a CSV of your asset tags into Jamf.
* **Criterion**: Asset Tag **is** `EDU-PROJ-A`.

1. **To Monitor Failure Points**:

* **Criterion**: Application Title **does not have** `Jamf Trust`.
* **Purpose**: This creates a "Live Hit List" of every device that has accidentally lost its reporting agent, allowing the ICT team to intervene precisely.

## How to Set it Up:

Log in to Jamf Pro > **Devices > Smart Device Groups > New**. After defining your criteria, check the box for **"Show in Dashboard."** This gives you a real-time "progress bar" on your management homepage to see how many devices are compliant with your school standards.
