## Q: I changed the device name in Jamf Pro, but the iPad still shows the old name locally. Why?

## Answer

**This is usually because you only modified the 'text record' in the Jamf Pro database but haven't sent the 'Remote Rename Command' to the physical device.**

Changing the name field directly in Jamf Pro's "General Search" or device details only updates the backend label; it does not actively trigger a change on the device.
To ensure the local name matches, successful admins use three correct methods:

**1. Automatic Naming via 'PreStage Enrollment'**

This is the recommended automated solution, naming the device the moment it activates:

* Configure in **PreStage Enrollment > Mobile Device Names**.

* **Use Variables**: You can use `$SERIALNUMBER` or `$ASSET_TAG` to generate names like `EDU-$SERIALNUMBER`.

* **Critical Checkbox**: You must check **Enforce Mobile Device Name on devices**. This ensures the device renames itself upon connecting to the network during setup.

**2. Manual Sync via 'Remote Commands'**

If you have already edited the name in the Jamf Pro device record, you must take the following actions:

* Click **Edit** on the device record and confirm the name change.

* Check the box **Enforce Mobile Device Name** below the name field and save.

* The system will immediately queue a `DeviceName` command to the iPad. Once the device receives it (must be unlocked and online), the local name will update.

**3. Batch Updates using 'Mass Actions' or The MUT**

When hundreds of devices need renaming:

* **Mass Actions**: Select specific devices in a Smart Group, then choose **Action > Send Remote Commands > Set Device Name**.

* **The MUT**: Upload a CSV file containing "Serial Number" and "Desired Name".

  * This tool updates the record and simultaneously triggers Jamf Pro to send rename commands to the physical devices.

**Why do commands get stuck?**

* **Unsupervised**: If the iPad is not in "Supervised" mode (via ADE), MDM cannot forcibly change its local name.

* **Command Pending**: If the device is off, offline, or sleeping, the rename command will sit in the `Pending` queue until the next Check-in.

**Practical Advice**

Admins should always check "Enforce Mobile Device Name" within Jamf Pro. This prevents students from arbitrarily changing names on the iPad, ensuring the backend inventory always matches the physical device.
