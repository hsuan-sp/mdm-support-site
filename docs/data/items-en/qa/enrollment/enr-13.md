## Q: How do I prevent students from removing the MDM management profile?

## Answer

**The key to preventing profile removal is using the 'Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)' process and enabling mandatory locking in the 'PreStage Enrollment' settings.**

If a device is enrolled manually (e.g., via a manual link or temporary Apple Configurator enrollment), students can remove the profile at any time under **Settings > VPN & Device Management**.

## Steps for Mandatory Control (Jamf Pro):

1. **PreStage Enrollment**: Ensure the device is assigned to the correct **Automated Device Enrollment** instance.
2. **Enable Mandatory Supervision**: Under the **Supervised Devices** section, ensure **Supervise Devices** is checked. This is the foundation for all advanced management; unsupervised devices cannot lock profiles.
3. **Lock the Profile (Crucial Step)**:

* Check **Prevent Unenrollment**.
  * **Result**: The "Remove Management" button will disappear from the iPad settings. Unless the device was added via Apple Configurator (which has a 30-day grace period), the student cannot manually remove the MDM profile.

## Supporting Security Measures:

* **Prevent Resets**: In a "Restrictions" profile, uncheck "Allow Erase All Content and Settings" to prevent students from wiping the device to bypass management.
* **Enable 'Return to Service'**: We recommend checking **Allow Return to Service** in the PreStage settings. This ensures that if a device must be reset, it can automatically reconnect and re-enroll.
* **Prevent Activation Lock**: Check **Prevent user from enabling Activation Lock** to stop students from locking the device to a personal Apple Account.

## Practical Advice:

* **Cannot be Retroactive**: If a student has *already* removed the profile, you cannot fix it remotely. You must wipe the device and have it go through the PreStage process with "Prevent Unenrollment" enabled.
* **Version Requirements**: For modern environments, we recommend setting a **Minimum Required iPadOS Version** (e.g., iPadOS 17+) in PreStage to ensure "Return to Service" and latest security features function correctly.
