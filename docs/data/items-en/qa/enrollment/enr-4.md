## Q: What is the difference between 'User Enrollment' and standard Device Enrollment?

## Answer

**User Enrollment is a privacy-first management mode specifically designed for "Bring Your Own Device" (BYOD) scenarios.**

Unlike standard enrollment used for school-owned iPads, User Enrollment (User-Driven) creates a **secure partition** on the device to separate school data from the student's personal photos, messages, and apps.

## Comparison Table:

| Feature | Device Enrollment (Standard/ADE) | User Enrollment (BYOD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ownership** | Institutional Asset | Personal Property |
| **Supervision** | Mandatory (Supervised) | Prohibited |
| **Data Isolation** | Full Device control | **Managed Data Partition only** |
| **Privacy Protection** | Standard school visibility | **Strict User Privacy** (IT cannot see personal apps or location) |
| **Remote Wipe** | Wipes the entire device | **Wipes school data only** (Personal photos remain safe) |
| **Removal** | Can be prevented by IT | **User can opt-out anytime** |

## Modern Approach (Account-Driven):

Apple now recommends **Account-Driven User Enrollment**. Instead of downloading a profile from a website, the student goes to **Settings > General > VPN & Device Management** and signs in with their **Managed Apple Account**. The device recognizes the campus ID and automatically sets up the school partition.

## Institutional Advice:

* **For School iPads**: Never use User Enrollment. You need the ability to lock and track the device if it’s lost.
* **For Staff/Shared personal use**: User Enrollment is the perfect balance for teachers who want to access school email on their personal iPhones without the school being able to see their private data.
