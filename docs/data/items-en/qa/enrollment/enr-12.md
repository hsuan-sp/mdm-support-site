## Q: What is 'Shared iPad'? How can students share devices and keep their data private?

## Answer

**'Shared iPad' is an Apple feature designed for non-1:1 environments. It allows multiple students to sign in to the same iPad using their 'Managed Apple Accounts' while maintaining independent workspaces.**

This solves the problem of student data (Safari history, projects, etc.) getting mixed up when sharing devices.

## Core Requirements:

1. **Managed Apple Accounts**: This is mandatory. Students must use their school-issued accounts so the system can identify and sync their personal data.
2. **Supervised Mode & ADE**: The device must be Supervised and enrolled via Automated Device Enrollment (ADE).
3. **Storage Planning**: The system divides the iPad's internal storage into multiple "User Spaces." For example, a 128GB iPad set for 10 users will pre-allocate a disk quota for each individual.

## How to Configure (via Jamf Pro):

1. **Navigate**: Go to **Mobile Devices > PreStage Enrollments**.
2. **Enable**: In your PreStage profile, find and check the **Shared iPad** option.
3. **Set User Capacity**: Define the **Maximum Number of Users**.

* **Storage Tip**: While iPadOS supports "Dynamic Quota," we recommend no more than 3 users for 64GB models. Larger models (128GB+) can accommodate more users.

1. **Wipe and Re-enroll**: If the device is not currently in Shared Mode, you **must wipe the device** and re-enroll it via the updated PreStage profile for the feature to take effect.

## Pros and Cons:

* **Pros**:
  * **Privacy**: Once a student logs out, the next user cannot access their data.
  * **Cloud Sync**: Projects started on Device A will sync (via iCloud) when the student logs into Device B.
  * **Cons**:
  * **Login Time**: The initial login requires downloading the user profile, which can take time on slower networks.
  * **Limited Storage**: If too many users are assigned, students may run out of space when installing large apps or filming high-res video.
  * **Guest Sessions**: You can enable Temporary Sessions for account-free login, but all data is wiped immediately upon logout.

## Practical Advice:

Shared iPad relies heavily on stable, high-speed campus Wi-Fi. Before deployment, perform a "First Login Test" to ensure sync speeds meet your instructional needs.
