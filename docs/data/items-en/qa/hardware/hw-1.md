# Q: We have both older Lightning iPads and newer USB-C models. How do we manage accessories and Apple Pencils?

# Answer

**As your school transitions to newer hardware, managing a mixed fleet of Lightning (iPad 9 and older) and USB-C (iPad 10 and newer) devices requires careful planning regarding peripherals and charging infrastructure.**

### Apple Pencil Compatibility:

1.  **iPad 9 (Lightning)**: Only compatible with **Apple Pencil (1st Generation)**. It pairs by plugging the pencil directly into the iPad's Lightning port.
2.  **iPad 10 (USB-C Base Model)**:
    *   **Using 1st Gen Pencil**: Requires the **"USB-C to Apple Pencil Adapter."** Because this adapter is small and easily lost, we recommend teachers manage these centrally.
    *   **Using USB-C Pencil**: Pairs via a USB-C cable. Note that this model does *not* support pressure sensitivity.
3.  **iPad Pro/Air (M-series Chips)**:
    *   **Major Change**: These high-end models use a different magnetic structure and **do not support Apple Pencil (2nd Gen)**.
    *   **Compatible**: Only **Apple Pencil Pro** (recommended for "Find My" support) or **Apple Pencil (USB-C)**.

### Charging Cart & Cable Management:

*   **Zoning the Cart**: We strongly recommend "Hard-wiring" regions of your charging carts. For example, dedicate slots 1-15 for Lightning cables (Year 5) and slots 16-30 for USB-C cables (Year 6). Use clear external labels to guide students.
*   **Cable Quality**: USB-C carries higher power and uses complex protocols. Ensure you use certified, high-quality cables. Poor-quality cables are the leading cause of "ghost touching" and charging IC failures in classroom environments.
*   **Avoid Adapters**: Do not use small "Lightning to USB-C" dongles inside a charging cart. Students often snap these off inside the iPad's port, leading to expensive repairs. Replacing the entire cable is a much more durable long-term solution.

### Institutional Advice:
Maintain a "Hardware Mapping Table" that matches device serial numbers to specific peripherals. When upgrading hardware, evaluate the total cost of ownership, including the required new adapters or Pencils.
