## Q: An iPad isn't charging inside the cart. Is the device faulty or the cart?

## Answer

**When an iPad fails to charge, we recommend a "Systematic Cross-Testing" approach to isolate the failure point between the device, the cable, and the cart’s power module.**

## Cross-Testing Workflow:

## Stage 1: Slot and Cable Test

1. Move the non-charging iPad to a **known working slot** in the cart (one that successfully charged another iPad).
1. Wait 30 seconds. Does the "Lightning bolt" icon appear in the status bar?

* ✅ **If it charges**: The original cable or the power brick for that specific slot is likely faulty.
* ❌ **If it still doesn't charge**: Move to Stage 2.

## Stage 2: Independent Power Test

1. Remove the iPad from the cart and use a **trusted standalone 20W charger** and cable (direct to a wall outlet).

* ✅ **If it charges**: The issue is with the cart’s internal power distribution or a tripped breaker.
* ❌ **If it still doesn't charge**: The issue is almost certainly a **hardware failure on the iPad**.

## Stage 3: Physical Inspection

* **Port Check**: Use a flashlight to inspect the Lightning or USB-C port for lint, dust, or student-inserted debris. Carefully clear it using a non-conductive tool (like a wooden toothpick) or compressed air.
* **Deep Discharge**: If an iPad has been dead for months, the battery voltage may be critically low. Keep it plugged into a high-wattage wall charger for at least **60 minutes** before declaring it a hardware failure.

## Institutional Advice:

* **Warranty**: If the device is found to be faulty (e.g., a burned-out charging IC), verify its warranty status before sending it for repair.
* **Spare Parts**: Cables are consumables. IT departments should keep a 5-10% stock of spare cables to quickly swap out damaged ones in classroom carts.
