## Q: How do I use 'Find My' to track lost Apple Pencil Pro styluses on campus?

## Answer

**The Apple Pencil Pro (released May 2024) is the first Apple stylus to support the 'Find My' network. This is a game-changer for schools, as it allows for tracking even when the pencil is not magnetised to an iPad.**

## How Tracking Works:

1. **Proximity View**: Within the Find My app, you can see the Pencil's last known location. If you are nearby, you can use the "Finding" interface (similar to AirTags) to get a signal strength display that lets you know if you are getting "Warm" or "Cold" as you walk around the classroom.
2. **Global Network**: If a student leaves their Pencil in the gym and goes home, any school-owned iPad or iPhone passing nearby will securely and anonymously relay the Pencil's location to the Find My network.

## Security and Management (Shared iPad):

* **Constraint**: Like all Find My items, the Apple Pencil Pro is paired to a **specific Apple Account**.
* **Shared iPad Conflict**: On a Shared iPad, if the student is using a temporary "Managed Apple Account," the Pencil may not be persistently trackable by the school MDM.
* **Recommendation**: For school-owned pencil sets, pair them initially with a "Primary Admin Account" or assign them to specific 1:1 units.

## Practical Advice for Schools:

* **Engraving**: Since tracking by App is not perfect, we still recommend physical engraving or applying serialized asset labels to the Pencil body.
* **Inventory**: Encourage students to check their "Find My" list at the start and end of every class period to ensure their Pencil is still "With You."
