## Q: I heard that moisture exposure voids the warranty. Where is the iPad Liquid Contact Indicator (LCI)?

## Answer

**Unlike the iPhone, no current iPad models (including the iPad 9th, 10th, and 11th generations) have an 'externally visible' Liquid Contact Indicator (LCI).**

Moisture determination is made by authorized technicians after disassembling the device to inspect internal indicators.

## How Service Centers Determine Liquid Damage:

1. **Internal LCI Inspection**: During a **Visual Mechanical Inspection (VMI)** at an Apple Authorized Service Provider (AASP), technicians check LCI stickers placed on the logic board or near critical flex cables. If the sticker has turned **red** due to liquid contact, the device is classified as having liquid damage.
2. **External Secondary Indicators (Corrosion)**: Even if internal stickers aren't visible, technicians look for:

* White powder or green corrosion on the charging port (Lightning/USB-C) or speaker meshes.
  * Liquid residue or "water spots" behind the screen assembly.

1. **Warranty Impact**: Liquid damage is not covered under the standard Apple one-year limited warranty. In most maintenance contracts, it is treated as accidental damage caused by the user.

## Practical Advice & Prevention:

* **Storage Environment**: Avoid storing devices near water dispensers or in unventilated, high-humidity warehouses during breaks. Long-term exposure to extreme humidity can trigger internal LCIs even without direct liquid spills.
* **Cleaning Risks**: **Never spray cleaning liquids directly** onto the iPad screen or into any openings. Capillary action can pull liquid inside, leading to a "liquid damage" diagnosis during repair.
* **Pre-submission Check**: If an iPad fails to charge, visually inspect the port for discoloration or debris. Be honest when describing the issue to the service center to avoid disputes over repair quotes.
