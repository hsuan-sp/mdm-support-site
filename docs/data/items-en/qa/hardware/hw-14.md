## Q: Why can't our firewall see the iPad's real MAC address?

## Answer

**This is because iPadOS enables 'Private Wi-Fi Address' by default, generating a randomized virtual MAC address for each SSID.**

This prevents commercial tracking but can break campus network systems that rely on "MAC Address Binding" for IP assignments or access control.

## Solution (via MDM):

Do not ask students to manually disable this. Instead:

1. Navigate to the **Wi-Fi Configuration Profile** in Jamf Pro.
2. Check the option **Disable MAC Address Randomization**.
3. **Result**: When the device connects to the school SSID, it will be forced to report its real hardware MAC address, allowing network infrastructure to identify the asset correctly.
