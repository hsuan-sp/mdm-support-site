# Q: Can teachers see every student's screen using the Apple Classroom app?

# Answer

**Yes. This is a core feature of the Apple Classroom app, though it includes built-in privacy safeguards to ensure student awareness.**

### How it Works:
*   **Real-time Monitoring**: From their iPad or Mac, the teacher can view live thumbnails of every student's screen in the class.
*   **Individual Inspection**: Tapping a thumbnail allows the teacher to zoom in and view a specific student's work or progress in detail.

### Privacy Safeguards:
*   **The Blue Status Bar**: When a teacher is actively viewing a student’s screen, a **blue AirPlay icon** (or a blue pill-shaped bubble) appears in the status bar at the top of the student's iPad.
*   **Indelible Notification**: This notification is a hard-coded system feature of iPadOS. It cannot be disabled by IT or the MDM, ensuring students always know when their screen is being shared.

### Technical Requirements:
*   **Bluetooth & Wi-Fi**: Both teacher and student devices must have Bluetooth and Wi-Fi enabled and be within physical proximity (the same classroom).
*   **Supervised Status**: Student iPads must be in **Supervised Mode** for the teacher to view the screen without the student needing to tap "Accept" for every session.
*   **MDM Permissions**: The management profile pushed to the student device must explicitly allow "AirPlay and Screen View."
