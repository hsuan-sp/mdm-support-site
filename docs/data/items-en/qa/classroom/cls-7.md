## Q: The teacher iPad shows 'Waiting for devices...' or 'Offline'. Why aren't commands sending?

## Answer

**This is usually caused by a "Bluetooth Discovery Failure" or "Wi-Fi LAN communication being blocked."**

Apple Classroom relies on two layers of communication to function:

1. **Bluetooth (Discovery)**: Used to find nearby students.

1. **Wi-Fi (Transport)**: Used to transmit commands and screen data.

## Troubleshooting Checklist:

## 1. Check for 'Client Isolation' on the Wi-Fi Access Point (AP)

This is the most common culprit. If your school's AP has this feature enabled, devices connected to the same AP **cannot communicate with each other.**

* **Symptoms**: The teacher can "see" students online (discovered via Bluetooth), but when attempting to view a screen or send a command, it spins indefinitely (the Wi-Fi packet cannot be delivered).

* **Solution**: Ask your network administrator to disable "Client Isolation" on the SSIDs used for instruction.

## 2. Bluetooth Signal Interference

If the classroom is crowded with other Bluetooth devices (keyboards, mice, microphones), it may interfere with the Classroom broadcast.

* **Tip**: Try having the teacher move closer to the student devices to test connectivity.

## 3. Confirm Devices are on the Same Subnet

Both teachers and students must be connected to the same SSID, and their IP addresses must be within the same subnet for screen sharing and data transfer to function correctly.
