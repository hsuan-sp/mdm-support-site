## Q: On a [Shared iPad], can students log in without a password? Is there a 'Guest Mode'?

## Answer

**Yes. Shared iPad supports 'Guest Sessions', allowing users to log in without an account.**

## Features and Limitations:

1. **Login**: Tap the **Guest** button below the user icons on the sign-in screen.

1. **Temporary Storage**: Any Safari history, photos, or documents created during the session are only stored locally.

1. **Wipe on Logout**: This is the most important feature. **Once the user logs out, all guest data is permanently wiped and cannot be recovered.**

## Use Cases:

* Public kiosks in the library.

* Temporary sessions for younger students who haven't yet received Managed Apple Accounts.

## Configuration:

In the Jamf Pro **PreStage Enrollment** settings, find the "Shared iPad" section and check **Allow Temporary Session** (previously known as Guest Login).
