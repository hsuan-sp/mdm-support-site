## Q: Can I restrict students to using only one specific app during my lesson?

## Answer

**Yes. Teachers can use Apple Classroom to temporarily "lock" students into a specific application.**

This is particularly useful for assessments (e.g., Kahoot, Quizlet), focused writing tasks, or ensuring everyone is on the same page during a science lab.

## How to Execute:

1. In the Classroom app, select the entire class or specific students.
2. Tap the **"Open"** tool.
3. Select the target app from the list.
4. Toggle on the switch for **"Lock in app after opening."**
5. Tap "Done." The student devices will automatically launch the app and disable the Home button and multitasking.

## How to Unlock:

* Tap the **"Unlock"** button in the teacher’s toolbar.
* The devices will also automatically unlock when the teacher ends the class session.

## Practical Tip:

This feature triggers a temporary "Single App Mode." If a student device becomes disconnected from the network, the unlock command might be missed. If a device remains stuck after class, a simple restart usually resolves the issue.
