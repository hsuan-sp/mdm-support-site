## Q: Troubleshooting: Bluetooth is on, but why does Apple Classroom show the students as 'Offline'?

## Answer

**This is usually caused by missing 'Local Network' permissions or an expired teacher certificate.**

## Troubleshooting Checklist:

1. **Check 'Local Network' Privacy (Most Common)**:

* On both teacher and student iPads, go to **Settings > Privacy & Security > Local Network**.

* Ensure the toggle for **Classroom** is turned **ON**. If this is off, the app is blocked from "seeing" other devices on the same Wi-Fi.

1. **Reset the Bluetooth Stack**:

* Toggle Bluetooth OFF and ON for both the teacher and several students. If this fails, a device restart is the next step.

1. **Education Profile Status**:

* If the entire class is showing as offline, the **"Education Configuration Profile"** issued by your MDM (Jamf Pro) may have expired or been revoked. Contact the ICT department to re-push the education settings.

1. **Wi-Fi Segmentation**:

* While devices are discovered via Bluetooth, data is exchanged over Wi-Fi. Ensure everyone is on the same **SSID** and that "Client Isolation" is disabled on your campus wireless access points.
