## Q: The class is too loud! How do I 'Lock' all student screens at once?

## Answer

**By using the "Lock" feature in Apple Classroom, you can instantly turn all student iPad screens black to get the class’s attention.**

This is a favorite "Eyes on Me" tool for teachers when they need the class to stop working and look at the front of the room.

## How it Works:

1. Tap the **"Lock"** icon in the Classroom toolbar.
2. Every student iPad screen will immediately turn black and display a lock message (e.g., "This device is locked by your teacher").
3. Touch input and physical buttons will be disabled until the teacher taps **"Unlock."**

## Technical Note:

This command is triggered via Bluetooth, making it nearly instantaneous. While the screen is locked, the iPad’s background processes (like app downloads or file uploads) will **not** be interrupted. It only blocks the user interface.
