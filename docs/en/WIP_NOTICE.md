We are committed to providing precise, high-quality technical documentation for international schools and IT administrators. While our team has rigorously reviewed the content, the complexity of MDM technical terms means there is always room for refinement.

### Scope of Verification
*   **Technical Accuracy**: Verified against Apple's 2026 deployment references.
*   **Terminology**: Aligned with industry-standard ASM/MDM glossaries.
*   **Localization**: Adapted for an international audience, removing Taiwan-specific administrative jargon where applicable.
