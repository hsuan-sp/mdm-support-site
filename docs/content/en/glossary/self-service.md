## Term Definition

** Self Service ** is a custom app portal provided by Jamf Pro, acting as a corporate "App Store."

Benefits:

* ** Autonomy ** : Allows students and staff to install approved apps, printers, and scripts on-demand without needing IT help.
* ** Security ** : Actions run with admin privileges, meaning users don't need to know the administrator password to install software.
* ** Troubleshooting ** : Often includes "Fix It" buttons (scripts) that users can run to reset their own Wi-Fi or clear cache.

## Analogy

Self Service is the ** "Campus Supply Store." ** If a student needs a specific calculator app or a teacher needs a new version of Zoom, they don't have to fill out a request form and wait for IT.

They just ** "walk into the store" ** (open the app), click install, and the item is delivered to their device immediately—all pre-approved, free, and safe to use.
