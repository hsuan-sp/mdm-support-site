## Term Definition

**Declarative Software Updates** is the standard, modern method for managing software updates in the Apple ecosystem, expected to be the primary framework starting in 2026.

Fundamental changes:

- **Phase-out** : Legacy MDM update commands (like `ScheduleOSUpdate`) are being replaced by the DDM "Configuration" mechanism.
- **Deadlines** : Supports strict **Enforcement Deadlines** where the device will force an update at a specific date and time.
- **Betas** : Allows administrators to remotely enroll or restrict devices in Apple’s **Beta Software Programs** .
- **Reporting** : Provides real-time progress updates through the **Status Channel** (e.g., "Downloading," "Verifying," "Installing").

**Note** : While the transition began with iOS 17 and macOS 14, Apple has announced the full deprecation of legacy MDM update commands by late 2026.

## Analogy

Previously, updating was like **"A teacher personally chasing every student"** to turn in their homework (the MDM server sending individual, repeated commands).

Now, it's like **"Posting the due date on the bulletin board"** and letting the students manage their own time. The device knows the deadline and handles the update autonomously when the time is right, just reporting back to the teacher when it's done.

## MDM Outlook

⚠️ **Important Reminder**: To align with Apple's platform trajectory, schools are encouraged to transition their update strategies to DDM by late 2026 to ensure continuous management capabilities.
