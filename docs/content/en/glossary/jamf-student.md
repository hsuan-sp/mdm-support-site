## Term Definition

**Jamf Student** is a dedicated companion application for student iPads that facilitates a managed learning environment.

Key functions:

* **Lesson Participation** : Allows students to receive websites, documents, and app links pushed directly from the **Jamf Teacher** app.
* **Communication** : Provides a secure portal for students to ask for help or submit specific classroom assignments.
* **Restrictions** : It is the endpoint that receives and executes "focused learning" commands, such as locking the iPad into a single required app for a test.

## Analogy

Think of this as the **"Learner's Digital Portal"** on the iPad.

It's the app that "listens" for the teacher's instructions. When a teacher wants everyone to look at the same specific webpage, they send the link, and the **Jamf Student** app automatically "catches" it and opens it for the student.

It helps keep every student in the room synchronized during a lesson so nobody falls behind or gets distracted.
