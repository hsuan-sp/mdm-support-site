## Term Definition

**Apple Business Manager (ABM)** is a web-based portal designed for IT administrators to manage Apple deployments at scale. It serves as the foundation for modern device management.

Key functionalities include:

* **Device Management** : Assigning devices to MDM servers via **Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)** .
* **Content Distribution** : Purchasing apps and books in volume through the **Volume Purchase Program (VPP)** .
* **Identity Management** : Creating and managing **Managed Apple Accounts** for employees.

An MDM server must be linked to ABM to prove organizational ownership of devices and enable **Zero-Touch deployment** .

## Analogy

ABM is the **"Central Assets Headquarters"** for an organization's Apple devices.

Every piece of hardware the company buys and every software license is registered here first. Think of the **MDM** as a third-party management company that must get a **"Central Key"** from the Headquarters (ABM) before it is allowed to enter and manage the company's property.
