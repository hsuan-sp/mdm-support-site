## Term Definition

**Federated Authentication** is an identity bridge that connects Apple Business/School Manager to an external **Identity Provider (IdP)** .

Supported Providers:

* **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)**
* **Google Workspace**

Benefits:

* **Single Sign-On (SSO)** : Students and staff can log in to their **Managed Apple Accounts** using their standard school email and password.
* **Account Consolidation** : Reduces management overhead by eliminating the need to create and maintain separate passwords for Apple IDs.
* **Security** : Leveraging existing MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) policies from the school's primary identity system.

## Analogy

Think of this as **"One Key for Every Door."** Just as many websites allow you to "Log in with Google," **Federated Authentication** lets you log in to your school iPad using your regular school email and password.

You don't have to remember a separate "Apple ID password" just for school assignments. If you change your password at the main office, it automatically updates for your iPad too, making your digital life much simpler.
