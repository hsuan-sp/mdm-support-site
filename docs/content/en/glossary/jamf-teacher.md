## Term Definition

** Jamf Teacher ** is a classroom management application that empowers educators to manage student technology directly and instantly.

Core capabilities:

* ** App Lock ** : Force a class of iPads into a single specific app (e.g., a calculator or a quiz app).
* ** Web Restrictions ** : Create a "Safe List" of websites that students are allowed to visit during a specific lesson.
* ** Content Pushing ** : Instantly send links, documents, or apps to every student at once.
* ** Attention Request ** : Send notifications to student screens to get their attention during a transition.

Teachers can manage their own specific classes based on synchronized rosters from ** Apple School Manager ** .

## Analogy

Think of this as the ** "Digital Pointer" ** or ** "Classroom Remote Control" ** for the modern teacher.

Instead of a teacher having to walk around the room to see what every student is doing on their screen, they can use this app on their own iPad to keep everyone focused. With one single button, the teacher can make sure all 30 students are looking at the exact same textbook page at the same time, preventing anyone from getting lost or distracted by games.
