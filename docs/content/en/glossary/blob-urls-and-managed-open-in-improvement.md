category: ["Security"]

## Term Definition

A security enhancement introduced in **OS version 26** that bridges a common loophole in data protection.

Functional details:

* **Scope** : **Blob URLs** (temporary, browser-generated links used to handle data inside a session).
* **Enforcement** : These links now strictly respect **"Managed Open-In"** restrictions.
* **Goal** : Prevents users from bypassing organization-level **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** policies by using browser-based "Blob" links to export sensitive files from managed apps to unmanaged personal accounts.

## Analogy

Previously, there was a **"Hidden Secret Passage"** (Blob URLs) that allowed users to move files out of the school's secured area and bypass the "No Exporting" rules.

Now, the security guard ( **Managed Open-In** ) also monitors these secret passages, ensuring that school data remains strictly inside the approved school applications and doesn't "leak" out.
