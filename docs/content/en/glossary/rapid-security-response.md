## Term Definition

** Rapid Security Response (RSR) ** is a nimble update mechanism designed by Apple to deploy urgent security fixes.

Differences from standard updates:

* ** Agility ** : Delivers important vulnerability patches*between* major software updates.
* ** Speed ** : RSR files are smaller and install significantly faster than a full OS upgrade.
* ** Uptime ** : Often requires only a quick restart (or sometimes no restart at all for Safari-only patches), minimizing classroom disruption.
* ** Version ** : Indicated by a letter after the version number (e.g., iOS 16.4.1 (a)).

## Analogy

Think of this as a ** "Digital Emergency Band-Aid." ** Instead of performing a major multi-hour surgery (a full system update) that forces you to stop working, Apple can quickly slap on a small "patch" to fix a specific cut (security hole).

It’s fast, simple, and makes sure your iPad is protected from a new threat the moment it's discovered, without making you wait through a 20-minute update screen.
