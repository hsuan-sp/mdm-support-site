## Term Definition

** Apple Classroom ** is a specialized app that provides teachers with powerful classroom management and monitoring tools.

Key capabilities:

* ** Screen View ** : Teachers can monitor student screens in real-time.
* ** App Lock ** : Lock devices into a specific app or website for focused learning.
* ** Resource Sharing ** : Instantly share documents, web links, or students' screens to an Apple TV. ** Technical Note ** : Because it operates over local Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, it is highly responsive and does not rely on the MDM server for its real-time interactions.

## Analogy

Think of this as the ** "Classroom Remote Control" ** for teachers.

On their iPad, a teacher can see exactly what every student is doing. If a student gets distracted, the teacher can instantly lock their screen or switch them to the correct textbook app, ensuring the whole class stays on task during the lesson.
