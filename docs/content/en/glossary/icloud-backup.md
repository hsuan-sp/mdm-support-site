## Term Definition

**iCloud Backup** is an automated cloud service that replicates a device's data and settings to Apple’s secure servers.

Execution criteria:

- **Connectivity** : The device must be connected to Wi-Fi.

- **Power** : The device must be plugged into a power source (charging).
- **State** : The device screen must be locked (usually occurring overnight).

**MDM Governance** : Depending on the school's data privacy policy, IT can either mandate iCloud Backup to ensure student work is never lost, or restrict it if data must remain strictly on-premises for legal reasons.

## Analogy

This is the **"Automatic Digital Safety Net."** Every night while the student's iPad is sleeping and charging, it quietly packs up all their school work, photos, and settings and stores a safety copy in the "Cloud" (a secure digital warehouse).

If the iPad is dropped and shattered the next morning, IT can just give the student a brand new iPad. Once they log in, their entire **"digital life"** will come back exactly as it was, like nothing ever happened.
