## Term Definition

**Client Isolation** (also known as **AP Isolation** or Wireless Isolation) is a network security configuration on a wireless access point (AP).

Effect on Managed Devices:

* **Security** : Prevents connected devices from communicating directly with each other on the same Wi-Fi network, stopping the spread of malware.
* **Functionality Loss** : It immediately disables peer-to-peer Apple services that rely on local discovery.
* **Affected Services** : **AirPlay** , **AirDrop** , and student monitoring features in **Apple Classroom** will fail to connect if Client Isolation is enabled.

## Analogy

Think of this as **"Anti-Social Mode"** for Wi-Fi.

Every device is put into its own soundproof, transparent room. They can all see the "Internet" outside, but they can't see or hear who else is in the next room.

While this makes the building very safe, it means students can't use AirPlay to project their screen or AirDrop files to their group members, because they aren't allowed to "talk across the hallway."
