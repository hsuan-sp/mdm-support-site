## Term Definition

An **Admin Account** is a privilege level in macOS that grants full control over the system.

Users with Admin rights can:

- **Install Software** : Add or remove applications at the system level.

- **Modify Settings** : Change network configurations, security policies, and system-wide preferences.
- **Manage Users** : Create, delete, or reset passwords for other local accounts.

In managed environments, IT departments typically maintain a hidden **management Admin account** for maintenance while downgrading regular users to **"Standard User"** status to prevent unauthorized changes.

## Analogy

This is the **"Grand Commander"** of the computer.

Whoever has this account can change anything, delete anything, or install any software. For safety, only IT staff usually have this level of access.

Everyone else is given a **"Standard Account,"** meaning they can use the computer to do their work, but they can't mess with the "engine" under the hood.
