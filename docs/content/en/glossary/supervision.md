## Term Definition

**Supervision** is a higher level of device management ownership available for institutional Apple devices.

Capabilities unlocked by Supervision:

* **Silent App Install** : Push apps without asking the user for permission.
* **Kiosk Mode** : Lock the device into a single app (Single App Mode).
* **Web Filtering** : Enforce global HTTP proxies to filter content.
* **Lost Mode** : Locate the device if it goes missing.
* **Security** : Prevent the user from removing the MDM profile or erasing the device.

Devices enrolled via **Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)** are supervised by default.

## Analogy

Supervision is the device's **"School Asset Mode."** A personal iPhone you buy from a store is in **"Personal Mode"** —most settings cannot be locked down.

Once a device is **Supervised** , it is recognized as **"School Property."** This unlocks full management capabilities for IT, allowing them to lock down any feature and ensuring the device is always safe and ready for learning.
