## Term Definition

**Activation Lock** is an Apple security feature designed to prevent unauthorized use of a lost or stolen device. It is a part of the **"Find My"** service.

How it works:

- It is automatically enabled when **Find My** is turned on.
- Once a device is reset, the original user's Apple ID and password are required to reactivate it.

While highly effective for anti-theft, it can be a challenge for organizations if a student or staff member leaves without signing out. In such cases, administrators must use an **Activation Lock Bypass Code** or request a lock removal from Apple Support.

## Analogy

Think of this as the device's **"Anti-Theft Deadbolt."** Even if a thief completely wipes the iPad, they will be greeted by a lock screen requiring your specific password. It makes the device useless to anyone but the rightful owner.

However, it can become a **"Zombie Device"** if a student graduates and forgets to unlock it—leaving the school with hardware that can't be reused without an IT "Override Key."
