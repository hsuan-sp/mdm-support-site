## Term Definition

** Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) ** is a security framework designed to manage and rotate local admin credentials on fleet devices.

Security mechanism:

* ** Uniqueness ** : Ensures every single managed computer has a different, unique local administrator password.
* ** Rotation ** : Automatically changes the password after a set period (e.g., every 30 days) or after it has been viewed by IT.
* ** Escrow ** : The current password is typically stored securely in the MDM or directory service for authorized retrieval.
* ** Defense ** : Prevents ** "Lateral Movement" ** attacks where compromising one computer's password would otherwise grant access to every computer in the organization.

## Analogy

Think of this as an ** "Automatic Lock-Changing System." ** In the past, every classroom door in a school might have used the same "Master Key." If a thief stole that key, they could enter every room.

With ** LAPS ** , every single door has a different, unique code that changes every few days. Even if someone steals a code today, it won't work on the next door, and it won't even work on the *same* door tomorrow.
