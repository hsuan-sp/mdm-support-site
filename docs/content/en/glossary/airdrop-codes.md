## Term Definition

Introduced in **iOS 26.2** , **AirDrop Codes** add an extra layer of privacy and security for wireless file sharing.

Key features include:

* **One-time Codes** : Users can generate a temporary code (valid for up to 30 days) for sharing with people not in their contacts.
* **Verification** : The recipient must enter this code to verify and accept the incoming transfer.
* **Privacy Protection** : Prevents unsolicited AirDrop requests and ensures files are only sent to the intended recipient.
* **MDM Context** :

Schools should evaluate how this affects their AirDrop policies. While it increases privacy, IT admins must ensure it doesn't bypass institutional restrictions. If MDM has disabled AirDrop entirely, the code functionality will also be unavailable.

## Analogy

In the past, AirDrop was like an **"Open Mailbox"** —anyone nearby could try to drop something in.

With **AirDrop Codes** , it's like adding a **"Combination Lock"** to your mailbox. Only the people you give the code to can send you files, making the experience much more private and secure.
