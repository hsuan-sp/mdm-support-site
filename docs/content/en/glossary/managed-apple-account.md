## Term Definition

A **Managed Apple Account** (formerly known as Managed Apple ID) is a professional identity owned and governed by the organization, not the individual.

Key differences from personal IDs:

* **Ownership** : Created and managed in bulk through **Apple School Manager (ASM)** or Apple Business Manager.
* **Services** : Provides access to core collaboration tools like iCloud Drive, Notes, and Schoolwork/Classroom.
* **Restrictions** : Users cannot make private App Store purchases, and features like "Find My" are disabled (organizations use MDM Lost Mode instead).
* **Federation** : Can be linked to Microsoft Azure or Google Workspace so students use their existing school email password to sign in.

## Analogy

Think of this as your **"Official School ID Card"** for the digital world.

Just like your school email address belongs to the school, this specific Apple account belongs to the school too. It is strictly for school work, storing your class files, and using school apps.

Because the school owns it, they can help you if you forget your password, but you shouldn't use it for your personal TikTok or for buying personal games.
