## Term Definition

In educational technology, a **Roster** is the digital dataset defining the relationship between students, teachers, and classes.

Data flow:

1. **Source** : Originates from the school's **Student Information System (SIS)** (e.g., PowerSchool, iSAMS).

2. **Sync** : Uploaded to **Apple School Manager** via SFTP or API.

3. **Usage** : Populates apps like **Apple Classroom** and **Schoolwork** .

Accurate rostering ensures that when a teacher opens their iPad, they automatically see the correct list of 25 students sitting in front of them for "Period 1 Math," without manual data entry.

## Analogy

This is the **"Digital Roll Call List."** Instead of a teacher having to create a spreadsheet and type in every student's name one by one, the school's central computer system automatically **"pushes"** the list to the teacher's iPad.

It means that when Mr. Smith walks into Biology class, his iPad already knows exactly who is supposed to be there.
