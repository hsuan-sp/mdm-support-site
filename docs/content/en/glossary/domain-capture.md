## Term Definition

** Domain Capture ** is a powerful security feature within ** Apple Business/School Manager ** that allows an organization to assert authority over its email domain.

Requirements and Outcomes:

* ** Verification ** : The organization must prove ownership of the domain (e.g., `@school.edu`).
* ** Conflict Resolution ** : If a user previously created a personal Apple ID using an official institutional email address, the organization can "capture" it.
* ** Migration ** : The affected user is notified and must either change the email address of their personal account (to a personal email like Gmail) or allow the account to be converted into an official ** Managed Apple Account ** .

## MDM Context

Domain Capture is a prerequisite for ** Federated Authentication ** . It ensures that no unauthorized personal accounts can exist using the school's official identity, preventing data confusion and improving security.

## Analogy

Think of this as an ** "Official Property Claim." ** If a student used their school uniform (the school email) to go and open a private locker at the local train station (a personal Apple ID), the school is now saying, "That uniform belongs to us."

The student must then decide to either move their private belongings to their own locker at home or give the key to the school to be officially managed as part of the school's inventory.
