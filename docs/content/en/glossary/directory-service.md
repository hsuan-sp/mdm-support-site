## Term Definition

A ** Directory Service ** is a centralized software system that stores, organizes, and provides access to information about a network's users and resources.

Common implementations:

* ** Microsoft Active Directory (AD)

***** LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) ***** Cloud Identity ** : Azure AD (Entra ID), Google Workspace, or Okta. ** MDM Integration ** : By linking MDM to a Directory Service, organizations enable users to enroll devices and access institutional apps using their existing, familiar credentials. This ensures that when a user leaves the organization, their access is revoked across all managed devices simultaneously.

## Analogy

This is the school's ** "Master Registry" ** or ** "Digital Office Book." ** It contains a centralized record of every student and staff member—who they are, what department they belong to, and what they are allowed to do.

Other systems, like the MDM or the campus Wi-Fi, "ask" this book whenever someone tries to log in. This ensures that everyone's information is consistent and that nobody can "sneak into" the school's digital building without an official entry in the registry.
