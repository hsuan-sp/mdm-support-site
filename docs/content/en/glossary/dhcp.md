## Term Definition

** DHCP ** is a foundational network protocol that automates the assignment of IP addresses and other network parameters to devices.

How it works:

* ** Discovery ** : When a device connects to a network (Wi-Fi or Ethernet), it broadcasts a request for an address.
* ** Lease ** : The DHCP server "leases" a temporary IP address to the device from a pool.
* ** Renewal ** : The device periodically renews its lease to keep using that address.
* ** Efficiency ** : Prevents "IP conflicts" where two devices accidentally try to use the same address at the same time.

## Analogy

Think of this as a ** "Valet Parking Attendant" ** for the internet.

When you drive your car (your iPad) into the school's parking garage (the Wi-Fi network), the attendant automatically points you to an ** available parking spot ** (an IP address).

You don't have to wander around looking for an empty spot yourself, and you'll never accidentally try to park in a space that another car is already using. The attendant makes sure everyone has a place to park so they can join the party.
