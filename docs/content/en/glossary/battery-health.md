## Term Definition

**Battery Health** is a metric that indicates the current maximum capacity of a device’s battery relative to its capacity when new.

MDM integration allows:

- **Telemetry Collection** : Administrators can remotely monitor the health percentage of every device in the fleet.

- **Proactive Maintenance** : Identify devices with batteries below a critical threshold (e.g., 80%).
- **Prevention** : Schedule battery replacements before aging cells lead to performance throttling, unexpected shutdowns, or physical swelling (expanding batteries).

## Analogy

This is the **"Physical Exam Report"** for a battery.

A brand-new battery has 100% capacity, but it "loses its stamina" over time as it is used and recharged. IT doesn't need to manually check every iPad; they can just look at a digital report to see which students have **"tired" batteries** that need to be replaced, preventing a dead iPad in the middle of a lesson.
