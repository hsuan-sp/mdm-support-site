## Term Definition

**Setup Pane Skipping** is a configuration feature within **Declarative Device Management (DDM)** that suppresses specific UI interruptions.

DDM Improvements in macOS Tahoe:

- **Granular Control** : Admins can skip post-update "What's New" screens that typically appear after a major OS upgrade.

- **Context Awareness** : Can suppress prompts purely based on the device state (e.g., skip "Sign in to iCloud" if the device is a shared lab machine).
- **Efficiency** : Prevents students from getting stuck on configuration screens that are irrelevant to their classroom needs.

## Analogy

In the past, every time a Mac was updated, you had to **"watch a short commercial"** about the new features before you could start working.

With **Setup Pane Skipping** , the school tells the Mac to **"Skip the Intro."** This saves time and allows students to get straight to their work without having to click "Next" on five different screens just to open a web browser.
