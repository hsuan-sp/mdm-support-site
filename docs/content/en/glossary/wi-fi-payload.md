## Term Definition

A **Wi-Fi Payload** is the section of an MDM profile that configures wireless connectivity settings.

Contents:

- **SSID** : The name of the network to join.

- **Auto-Join** : Whether the device should connect automatically when in range.
- **Security Type** : E.g., WPA2/WPA3 Personal (Password) or Enterprise (RADIUS/Certificate).
- **Credentials** : The pre-filled password or identity certificate required to authenticate.

By deploying this payload, IT ensures devices connect to the secure network immediately without user intervention.

## Analogy

Think of this as an **"Automatic Login Sheet."** Instead of a teacher having to shout the Wi-Fi password across the room 30 times, IT **"whispers"** the password directly into the iPad's memory through the MDM.

The iPad **"reads"** the password and connects to the internet automatically, so you're ready to start working the moment you walk into the building.
