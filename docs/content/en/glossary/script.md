## Term Definition

A **Script** is a custom administrative program (typically written in Bash, zsh, or Python) executed on managed Macs.

Power and utility:

- **Beyond MDM** : While MDM profiles have standard checkboxes (like "Turn on Wi-Fi"), Scripts allow IT to code **anything** the computer is capable of doing.

- **Automation** : Can automatically repair broken printer settings, delete temporary cache files, or modify hidden system preferences.
- **Extension** : Used to calculate custom inventory data (Extension Attributes) that MDM doesn't collect natively.

## Analogy

Think of a Script as a **"Special Magic Spell."** The standard control panel has buttons for normal things like "Volume" or "Brightness." But sometimes, you have a weird problem that doesn't have a button.

So, the IT wizard writes a specific **Spell** (the Script) and tells the computer to cast it. The computer follows the spell's exact instructions to perform a complicated repair task that no standard button could ever do.
