## Definition

Jamf Data Policy is a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) capability within the Jamf ecosystem. It allows administrators to set specific rules to prevent sensitive institutional data from being leaked via methods like AirDrop, screenshots, or copy-pasting into unauthorized apps. All violations are logged and can be audited by the IT department to ensure compliance with school data security policies.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Digital Safety Net." It prevents sensitive school information (like exam papers or student records) from being shared where it shouldn't be. If someone tries to take a screenshot of a secret document or AirDrop it to a personal device, this "Safety Net" catches it and stops it, making sure school secrets stay safe.
