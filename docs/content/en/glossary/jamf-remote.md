## Definition

Jamf Remote Assist is a built-in remote desktop tool within Jamf Pro. It allows IT administrators to securely connect to a user’s Mac directly through a web browser to perform screen sharing, terminal commands, and file transfers for troubleshooting. It supports both "Attended" mode (where the user must grant permission) and "Unattended" mode for remote maintenance, eliminating the need for third-party remote control software.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Digital Window" for the IT team. If you're having trouble with your Mac, the IT person can look through this digital window (with your permission) to see your screen and help you fix the problem from their office. It’s like having a tech expert sitting right next to you, even if they are in another building or another city.
