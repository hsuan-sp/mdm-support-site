## Term Definition

** DNS over HTTPS (DoH) ** and ** DNS over TLS (DoT) ** are encrypted protocols designed to secure the "last mile" of a DNS query between a device and a DNS resolver.

Technical details:

* ** DoH (Port 443) ** : Encapsulates DNS queries within standard HTTPS traffic, making them indistinguishable from regular web browsing.
* ** DoT (Port 853) ** : Wraps DNS queries in a dedicated TLS tunnel.
* ** Goal ** : Prevents eavesdropping, tampering, and "Man-in-the-Middle" attacks by ISPs or malicious actors on public networks.

## MDM Context

While beneficial for privacy, DoH can be used to bypass school content filters. Solutions like ** Jamf Safe Internet ** utilize a managed DoH/DoT gateway to provide filtering while still maintaining high encryption standards.

## Analogy

Traditional DNS is like a ** "Postcard" ** —anyone handling the mail (like the ISP or a hacker on public Wi-Fi) can easily see exactly which website you are looking for. ** DoH/DoT ** is like placing that same request inside a ** "Sealed Security Envelope." ** The people handling the mail know you sent a message, but they have no way of knowing exactly which "address" you are looking for inside the envelope.
