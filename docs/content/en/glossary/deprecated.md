## Term Definition

** Deprecated ** is a status indicator signal that a specific technology, feature, or API is slated for removal.

Key points for IT:

* ** Functionality ** : A deprecated feature usually still works in the current OS version, but it is no longer being updated.
* ** Future Removal ** : It serves as an official warning that the feature will be deleted in a future major OS update.
* ** Action Required ** : IT administrators should treat "Deprecated" notices as a deadline to migrate to a newer, supported replacement.

## Analogy

Think of this as a ** "Notice of Demolition" ** posted on an old building.

The building hasn't been torn down yet, and you can still walk inside, but the blueprint for the new park replacing it has already been approved. ** IT administrators ** should start moving their digital furniture out as soon as possible so they aren't caught inside when the "Update Bulldozers" finally arrive to clear the site.
