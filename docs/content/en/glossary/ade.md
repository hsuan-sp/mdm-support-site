## Term Definition

**Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)** is the gold standard for deploying Apple devices at scale (formerly known as **DEP** ).

The workflow involves:

1. **Purchasing** : Devices are bought through an authorized reseller or Apple directly.

2. **Assignment** : Serial numbers are automatically added to the organization's **Apple School Manager (ASM)** or **Apple Business Manager (ABM)** account.

3. **Activation** : The moment the device is turned on and connected to Wi-Fi, it automatically downloads the school's MDM profile.

This process is mandatory and cannot be skipped by the end-user, enabling true **"Zero-Touch"** deployment.

## Analogy

This is the device's **"Factory-Level Identity."** It's as if every school iPad was born with the school's stamp on its digital forehead. No matter who holds the device or how many times it's reset, the moment it touches the internet, it **"calls home"** to the school’s management system and sets itself up according to the rules automatically.
