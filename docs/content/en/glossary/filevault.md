## Term Definition

**FileVault** is the integrated full-disk encryption (FDE) technology for macOS.

Technical features:

* **Encryption** : Uses **XTS-AES-128** encryption with a 256-bit key to prevent unauthorized access to data on the startup disk.
* **Boot Security** : Data is only decrypted once the user successfully logs into an authorized account (or IT uses a recovery key).
* **Recovery Keys** : Organizations can use MDM to generate and securely store a unique **Personal Recovery Key (PRK)** for every Mac, ensuring IT can always regain access if a user forgets their password.

Enforcing FileVault is a cornerstone of modern organizational security and data privacy compliance.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Digital Vault"** for the entire computer.

On an unprotected computer, a thief could simply pull out the hard drive and put it into their own machine to read your private files.

With **FileVault** turned on, the entire drive is scrambled into a complex code that only your specific key can unlock. Without that key, the hard drive is nothing more than a useless piece of scrap metal to anyone who finds it.
