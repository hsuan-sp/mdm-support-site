## Definition

Jamf Now is a streamlined, cloud-based MDM solution designed for small organizations or individual departments. It offers a simplified interface for essential tasks like device enrollment, app distribution, and security setting enforcement. While it lacks the advanced scripting and complex automation features of **Jamf Pro** , it is highly user-friendly and ideal for smaller schools or businesses with basic management needs.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Essentials Version" of the management software. While Jamf Pro is like a professional "Swiss Army Knife" with hundreds of tools, Jamf Now is more like a simple, reliable pocketknife. It has just the right tools for smaller schools to get the job done quickly and easily without needing a team of expert engineers.
