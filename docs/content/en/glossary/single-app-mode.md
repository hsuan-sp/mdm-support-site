## Term Definition

**Single App Mode** (also known as Kiosk Mode or App Lock) is a restrictive state that forces an iOS/iPadOS device to run only one specific application.

Use cases:

* **Assessment** : Locking the iPad to a test app so students cannot Google answers.
* **Kiosks** : Using an iPad as a dedicated visitor sign-in station or library catalog.
* **Ordering** : Restaurant menus.
* **Behavior** : Teachers using **Apple Classroom** to temporarily lock all student screens to a specific learning app ("Eyes on the textbook").

## Analogy

Think of this as **"Special Purpose Mode."** Just as a ticket machine at a train station is actually a computer but only lets you "buy tickets," Single App Mode turns an iPad into a **one-tool machine** .

If a student is taking an exam, they can't leave the test to check messages—they are **locked into the test** until the teacher says otherwise.
