## Term Definition

**PreStage Enrollment** is the Jamf Pro configuration profile that controls the **Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)** experience.

Customization options:

- **Setup Assistant** : Choose which screens to skip (e.g., skip "Apple Pay," "Siri," and "Terms of Service" screens) to speed up setup.

- **Authentication** : Require LDAP or SSO login credentials to ensure only authorized users can set up the device.
- **Identity** : Automatically set the device name and create a local administrator account during setup.
- **Supervision** : Enforce supervision status and mandatory MDM profile installation.

## Analogy

PreStage Enrollment is like a **"VIP Express Check-In"** at the airport.

Before the student even turns on their new iPad, the ICT department has already pre-filled all their paperwork.

When the student turns it on, they skip the long lines (the boring "Click Next" screens) and go straight to their destination: a fully functional device ready for class.
