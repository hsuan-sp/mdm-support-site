## Term Definition

A ** Token ** is a temporary digital key used for authentication in modern security systems (like OAuth or OIDC).

How it differs from a password:

* ** Temporary ** : A password lasts forever until changed; a token expires automatically (e.g., in 1 hour).
* ** Specific ** : A password unlocks everything; a token grants access only to specific resources (e.g., "Read Email" but not "Delete Email").
* ** Invisible ** : The user types their password once; the system exchanges tokens in the background for all subsequent actions, keeping the password safe.

## Analogy

Think of a Token as an ** "All-Day Wristband" ** at an amusement park.

You go to the front gate, show your ID, and pay (this is entering your password).

Instead of having to show your ID at every single ride, the park gives you a ** wristband ** (the Token). As long as you are wearing it, you can walk onto any ride instantly. If it falls off (expires), you just go back to the gate to get a new one.
