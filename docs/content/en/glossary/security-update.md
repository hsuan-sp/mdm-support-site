## Term Definition

A **Security Update** is a software patch dedicated solely to fixing vulnerabilities and protecting the operating system integrity.

Characteristics:

* **Focus** : Does not add new features (like new Emojis); only closes security holes.
* **Mandate** : MDM policies often force these updates to install immediately (0-day deadline) to protect the network.
* **Invisibility** : Modern **Rapid Security Responses** can sometimes be installed without the user even noticing, as they don't always require a restart.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Booster Shot"** for your device.

Just as a vaccine helps your body recognize and fight off new diseases without changing your personality, a **Security Update** teaches your iPad how to beat new computer viruses.

It doesn't change how the device looks or give you new cool tricks, but it keeps you alive and safe from invisible threats.
