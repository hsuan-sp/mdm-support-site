## Term Definition

** DMG ** is a proprietary Apple Disk Image file format used primarily for software distribution on macOS.

Key characteristics:

* ** Mounting ** : When opened, it behaves like a virtual external drive or CD-ROM appearing on the Desktop.
* ** Compression ** : Often compressed to save space during download.
* ** Usage ** : Typically used to deliver `.app` bundles. Users install software by dragging the application icon from the DMG into the `/Applications` folder.

In enterprise management, DMG files are often converted into ** .pkg ** files for automated deployment, as standard DMGs usually require manual user interaction to "drag and drop" the app.

## Analogy

Think of this as a ** "Virtual Software CD." ** Downloading a DMG is like being handed a digital disc. When you open it, your Mac "inserts" the disc, and a window pops up showing you what's inside.

Once you've copied the software onto your Mac's hard drive, you just "eject" the digital disc and throw the DMG file in the trash. It’s a clean and organized way to deliver a new tool to your computer.
