## Term Definition

** Apple Configurator ** is a physical management and diagnostic tool for macOS.

It is primarily used for:

* ** Bulk Provisioning ** : Setting up many devices via a wired connection.
* ** ABM Addition ** : Manually adding devices (not purchased through enterprise channels) into ** Apple Business Manager ** .
* ** Restoration ** : Reinstalling device firmware (IPSW) or reviving a "bricked" device.

It serves as the ** "last resort" ** tool for recovery when a device cannot be reached over the network via MDM.

## Analogy

Think of this as the ** "IT Workbench." ** If an iPad is completely frozen or won't connect to the internet, you use a USB cable to plug it into a Mac running Apple Configurator. It allows IT to ** "reinstall the engine" ** or force the device to register with the school's management system even if it was originally purchased at a regular retail store.
