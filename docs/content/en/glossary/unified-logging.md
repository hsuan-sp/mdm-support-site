## Term Definition

** Unified Logging ** is the central system for capturing and storing diagnostic messages on Apple platforms.

Key features:

* ** Centralization ** : Collects logs from the kernel, drivers, and user apps into one single database.
* ** Privacy ** : Automatically redacts sensitive info (like passwords) unless a special profile is installed.
* ** Troubleshooting ** : Administrators use the `log` command or ** Console.app ** to view these streams. It is the definitive way to find out*why*a profile failed to install or*why* an app is crashing.

## Analogy

Think of this as the ** "Black Box Flight Recorder" ** for your iPad or Mac.

It silently keeps a detailed diary of everything the computer is doing—from "Connected to Wi-Fi" to "Opened Calculator."

If the ** "plane" ** (your device) crashes, the ** "Investigators" ** (the tech team) look at the black box diary to see exactly what happened in the seconds before the trouble started.
