## Term Definition

**Return to Service** is a high-efficiency command for iOS and iPadOS devices that automates the device reset cycle.

Workflow:

1. **Wipe** : IT sends the "Erase Device" command.

2. **Persist** : The command includes a "Return to Service" package (Wi-Fi profile + Language settings).

3. **Reboot** : The device erases all user data.

4. **Reconnect** : Instead of stopping at the "Hello" screen, the device automatically connects to Wi-Fi using the saved profile.

5. **Re-enroll** : It contacts the MDM and re-enrolls itself automatically, ready for the next user.

## Analogy

Think of this as **"Reincarnation with Memory."** Usually, when you wipe an iPad, it "forgets" everything and acts like it was just born.

With **Return to Service** , the iPad is wiped clean, but it keeps a **"sticky note in its pocket"** (the Wi-Fi password). When it wakes up, it reads the note, connects to the internet, and reports back to the office for its duties immediately—without a human needing to touch it.
