## Analogy

In the past, unlocking an encrypted Mac was like **"Having to be there in person to turn the combination lock on a heavy safe."** Now, with SSH unlocking, it's like having a **"Verified Remote Remote Control."** As long as the computer is online, IT can securely unlock the "digital vault" from their office to fix a software error, saving them from having to walk across the entire campus to your specific desk just to type a password.
