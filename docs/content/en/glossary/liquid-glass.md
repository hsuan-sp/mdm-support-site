## Term Definition

**Liquid Glass** is the advanced visual design language introduced by Apple in **OS version 26** , drawing heavy inspiration from the spatial computing interface of visionOS.

Visual characteristics:

* **Materiality** : Features increased transparency, dynamic light reflections, and real-time blurring logic.
* **Depth** : Creates a fluid sense of depth where interface elements (like windows or dock icons) feel like they are floating on different layers of glass.
* **Adaptability** : The interface reacts subtly to environmental lighting conditions captured by the device's sensors.

**MDM Context** : Administrators should note that users can adjust the "opacity" of this effect in settings. Onboarding materials should clarify that this transparency is a stylistic choice, not a display hardware defect.

## Analogy

Imagine your iPad screen as a sheet of **"Living Glass."** When you move the device or change the lighting in the room, the icons and windows subtly catch the light and reflect it, just like real glass objects would. It makes the interface feel lighter, more breathable, and more "alive" than the flat, painted-on buttons of the past.
