## Term Definition

**802.1X** is an IEEE standard for port-based **Network Access Control (PNAC)** . It provides a robust authentication mechanism for devices wishing to attach to a LAN or WLAN.

In enterprise and school environments (such as **eduroam** ), 802.1X requires:

- Deployment of valid **digital certificates** or credentials to devices.
- Verification of these credentials by a **RADIUS server** before granting network access.

This is significantly more secure than a shared Wi-Fi password, as it ensures that only authorized devices with unique identities can enter the internal network.

## Analogy

Think of 802.1X as an **"Airport Security Checkpoint"** for your network.

- **Standard home Wi-Fi** is like a house key—anyone who has the key can walk in.
- **802.1X** requires everyone to show their own **passport** (certificate) and **ticket** (credentials).

If the identity doesn't match the security list, they aren't allowed through the gate.
