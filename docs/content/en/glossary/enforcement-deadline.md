## Term Definition

An **Enforcement Deadline** is a critical component of **Declarative Device Management (DDM)** that ensures mandatory actions are completed by a specific time.

Operational logic:

- **Notification Phase** : As the set date and time approach, the device provides increasingly frequent and persistent notifications to the user.

- **Enforcement Phase** : Once the deadline passes, the user can no longer dismiss or postpone the action (such as a software update).
- **Automation** : The device executes the task autonomously based on the server's declaration, ensuring fleet-wide compliance with security patches.

## MDM Context

Enforcement Deadlines are used for critical security remediations, such as mandatory macOS/iOS updates, to ensure 100% compliance without manual IT intervention or constant server polling.

## Analogy

Think of it as a **"Library Book Due Date."**

- One week before it's due, you get a gentle reminder.

- One day before, you get a more urgent alert.
- Once the **deadline** hits, the library "locks your account" or applies a fine until the book is returned.

Enforcement Deadlines ensure that critical rules are followed on time across the entire school, so no one is left vulnerable to old bugs.
