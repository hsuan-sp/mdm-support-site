## Term Definition

** Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) ** is an open, vendor-neutral standard for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services.

Common uses in MDM:

* ** User Lookup ** : Connecting the MDM to ** Active Directory ** or ** OpenLDAP ** to search for users.
* ** Group Sync ** : Importing student and teacher groups (e.g., "Grade 5 Staff") directly into the MDM for scoping policies.
* ** Authentication ** : Verifying a username and password against the central database during enrollment.

## Analogy

This is the ** "Common Language" ** used to check the school's central phonebook.

Just as two people from different countries might use English to communicate, different computer systems (like your MDM and your Email Server) use ** LDAP ** to "ask" the central database for information.

It allows the MDM to ask questions like: "Who is in Grade 5?" or "Is this password correct for Mr. Smith?".
