## Term Definition

The **Intel Mac End-of-Support Milestone** refers to the transition point where Apple’s modern operating systems no longer provide compatibility for older Macs powered by Intel processors.

Critical timelines:

* **Final Supported OS** : **macOS Tahoe (v26)** is the absolute final major release to support any Intel-based hardware.
* **Affected Hardware** : Includes the 2020 iMac and 2019 Mac Pro—the last Intel machines sold by Apple.
* **Management Impact** : Starting with the next major macOS release in 2027, many modern MDM commands and security features will require **Apple Silicon** (M-series) to function.

## Analogy

Think of this as the **"Final Stop for the Old Train."**

**macOS Tahoe** is the last version of the system that will work on older Macs with Intel chips. After this, any "New Trains" (future macOS versions) will only run on the newer, faster tracks (the Apple Silicon chips).

For a school's budget planning, this means that any Intel Macs still in classrooms are now in their "final years" and should be replaced soon so they don't become outdated, slow, and insecure.
