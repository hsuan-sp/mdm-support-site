## Term Definition

A **Push Notification** is a small, efficient data packet sent via the **Apple Push Notification service (APNs)** to wake a device.

How MDM uses it:

1. **Trigger** : The admin sends a command (e.g., "Install Microsoft Word").

2. **Push** : The MDM server sends a "Poke" to APNs.

3. **Wake** : APNs forwards this small packet to the iPad.

4. **Check-in** : The iPad wakes up from sleep and contacts the MDM server to ask, "What do you want me to do?"

5. **Action** : The iPad receives the instruction to install Word.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Digital Tap on the Shoulder."** To save battery, your iPad sleeps whenever it can. When the tech team wants to give you a new app, they can't shout at a sleeping iPad.

Instead, they send a **Push Notification** . It’s like a gentle tap that wakes the iPad up and whispers, *"Hey, the teacher has some new work for you; go call the server to get it!"*
