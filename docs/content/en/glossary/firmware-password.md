## Term Definition

A **Firmware Password** is a foundational security lock designed for Intel-based Macs. (Note: On modern Apple Silicon Macs, this has been superseded by **"Recovery Lock"** ).

What it protects:

* **Boot Control** : Prevents the Mac from booting from anything other than the designated startup disk (e.g., blocks booting from a USB drive).
* **Recovery Access** : Requires a password to enter macOS Recovery, preventing unauthorized users from wiping the computer or resetting the admin password.
* **Deep Security** : It acts as a barrier that exists before the operating system even starts to load.

## Analogy

Think of this as the **"Ignition Lock"** for a computer.

Standard login passwords are like the front door of your house—they keep uninvited people out of the rooms. A **Firmware Password** is like a specialized lock on the car's engine itself.

Without it, the computer won't even "start its engine" to let you reinstall the system. It makes the computer essentially worthless to a thief who wants to wipe and resell it.
