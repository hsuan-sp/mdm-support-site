## Term Definition

**iBeacon** is Apple's location-aware technology that uses **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** to detect proximity and trigger location-specific actions on mobile devices.

Educational applications:

- **Automation** : Automatically opening a specific textbook app when a student enters the library.

- **Restrictions** : Automatically muting iPad volume or disabling the camera as soon as a device "senses" it is inside the auditorium.
- **Inventory** : Helping IT locate sets of iPads within large buildings by identifying which beacon they are currently near.

## Analogy

Think of these as **"Invisible Sense-Posts"** or **"Digital Lighthouses"** placed around the school.

When an iPad walks past a post in the music room, it doesn't need to be scanned; the system just "senses" the location and can automatically tell the iPad, "You're in the music room now—please turn your volume down and open the sheet music app." It helps make the technology respond intelligently to exactly where the student is standing.
