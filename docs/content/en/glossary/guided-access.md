## Term Definition

**Guided Access** is a built-in iOS and iPadOS feature designed for accessibility and focused learning.

Key functionalities:

* **App Locking** : Temporarily restricts the device to a single application.
* **Hardware Control** : Disables the Home button or gestures (on newer iPads) to prevent the user from leaving the app.
* **Screen Customization** : Allows an administrator or teacher to disable specific areas of the screen to prevent accidental or unwanted interaction.
* **Time Limits** : Enables the setting of a specific duration for an activity.

Teachers frequently use Guided Access to transform an iPad into a dedicated assessment tool or a specific learning station.

## Analogy

This is the **"Single-App Lock Mode."** For example, before handing out an iPad for an end-of-unit exam, a teacher can triple-click a button to **"pocket"** the student into the testing app. The student won't be able to leave that app to peek at notes or switch to a game until the teacher enters a secret passcode to "unlock" the device back to normal. It’s a great way to help students stay 100% focused on their current work.
