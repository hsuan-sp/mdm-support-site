## Term Definition

** Compliance ** measures whether a managed device currently satisfies the organization’s mandatory security and configuration standards.

Typical compliance checks include:

* ** Passcode ** : Is a secure passcode set up and active?
* ** Version ** : Is the device running an approved and patched OS version?
* ** Integrity ** : Is the device free from unauthorized modifications (e.g., is not "Jailbroken")?
* ** Applications ** : Are mandatory security apps installed and running?

If a device drifts out of compliance, MDM can automatically trigger alerts or restrict its access to institutional resources like email or Wi-Fi.

## Analogy

Think of this as a ** "Digital Security Health Check." ** Before entering a high-security lab, you must be checked for proper gear (safety goggles, ID badge). Similarly, the system checks every device to see if it is "healthy" and following the rules.

If a device has an old, unpatched system or no password, it’s ** "out of compliance" ** and might be blocked from the school network until it is "healed" and following the security rules again.
