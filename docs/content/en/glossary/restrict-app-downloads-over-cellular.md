## Term Definition

**Restrict App Downloads over Cellular** is a modern policy configuration available via Declarative Device Management (DDM).

Functionality:

- **Constraint** : It explicitly forbids the App Store and MDM from downloading or updating apps while using a cellular (4G/5G) connection.

- **Enforcement** : Downloads will pause and wait until the device connects to a Wi-Fi network.
- **Purpose** : Prevents students with cellular-enabled iPads from accidentally exhausting the school's data plan quota with large game or OS updates.

## Analogy

Think of this as **"Wi-Fi Only Mode"** for heavy lifting.

It’s like a parent setting a rule that says: **"You can only download new video games when you are at home on Wi-Fi, not while you're on the bus using expensive phone data."** This creates a safety net so that one student downloading a huge game doesn't use up the entire class's data budget for the month.
