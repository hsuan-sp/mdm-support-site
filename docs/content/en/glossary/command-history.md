## Term Definition

**Command History** is a comprehensive audit log within the MDM console that tracks every action sent to an individual device.

Administrators use this history to:

* **Audit** : Verify when a specific command (like "Lock Device" or "Clear Passcode") was issued.
* **Troubleshoot** : Investigate error codes associated with failed app installations or profile deployments.
* **Track Status** : Monitor whether a command is currently **Pending** (device offline), **Succeeded** , or **Failed** .

## Analogy

This is the device's **"Instruction Log"** or **"Receipt Book."** Just as a bank statement lists every withdrawal and deposit, Command History lists every single instruction the school IT team has sent to that specific iPad.

If something goes wrong, IT doesn't have to guess what happened; they can check the history to see exactly which command got "stuck in the mail" and why.
