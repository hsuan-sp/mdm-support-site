## Term Definition

A **Local Account** is a user profile that resides strictly on the individual computer's hard drive.

Key differences from Network Accounts:

* **Authentication** : Usage is verified against a local database on the machine, not a central server.
* **Scope** : Credentials work **only** on that specific Mac; they cannot be used to log in to other computers.
* **Use Case** : Typically reserved for the primary "Administrator" account used by IT for maintenance, or for specialized stations (like a theater lighting controller) that do not require network connectivity.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Room-Specific Key."** This key (the account) only opens one specific door (one computer). If you try to use it on any other computer in the building, it won't work.

It’s different from a school **"ID Badge"** (Network Account) which scans you into any classroom, library, or lab computer across the entire campus.
