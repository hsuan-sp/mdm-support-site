## Definition

JamfAAD is a background process on macOS responsible for coordinating with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) for device registration and **Compliance** verification. When a user tries to access a protected school resource like Office 365 or Microsoft Teams, JamfAAD provides proof to Microsoft that the Mac is managed and meets all required school security standards before allowing the user to sign in.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Digital Diplomat" who speaks to Microsoft. When you try to open Word or Teams, the "Microsoft Security Guard" might block you. JamfAAD steps in and shows the guard an official letter that says, "Don't worry, this computer is safe and belongs to the school." Once the guard sees the letter, they let you in to do your work.
