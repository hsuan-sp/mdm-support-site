## Term Definition

** Apple Silicon ** refers to the custom system-on-a-chip (SoC) family (M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5 series) designed by Apple for the Mac and iPad.

These chips introduce advanced hardware-level security concepts:

* ** Volume Owner ** : A security model that requires a physical user with an account on the crystal-level secure enclave to authorize certain system actions.
* ** Boot Security ** : Enhanced verification of the operating system during startup.
* ** Authentication ** : Certain management tasks (like OS updates or changing security levels) require local credentials (password or Touch ID).

This represents a significant shift from Intel Macs, where MDM could often perform administrative tasks with broader, purely software-based authority.

## Analogy

This is the ** "High-Performance Engine" ** inside modern Apple computers.

While it's incredibly fast, it's also much more secure. Think of it like a supercar that requires both a ** physical key ** and a ** biometric scan ** to start the engine.

While it makes the computer almost impossible for a thief to use, it also means the school’s IT team has to use more sophisticated methods to keep everything updated and secure.
