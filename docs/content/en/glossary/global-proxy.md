## Term Definition

A ** Global HTTP Proxy ** setting is an MDM payload that enforces the routing of all device network traffic (HTTP/HTTPS) through a designated proxy server.

Typical organizational goals:

* ** Content Filtering ** : Denying access to inappropriate or dangerous websites at the gateway level.
* ** Auditing ** : Maintaining centralized logs of all internet usage for compliance and digital citizenship monitoring.
* ** Bypass Prevention ** : Ensuring that filtering remains active even when the device leaves the campus network. ** Technical Consideration ** : While excellent for security, some high-bandwidth applications (like video conferencing or heavy streaming) may experience latency or connection issues if the proxy server is underpowered or misconfigured.

## Analogy

Think of this as a ** "Mandatory Security Checkpoint" ** for all internet traffic.

Every "car" (piece of data) trying to leave or enter the device must first drive through this single checkpoint to be inspected by a guard. While this allows the school to filter out "contraband" (blocked websites), it can sometimes cause a ** "traffic jam" ** (slower internet speeds) because every single thing has to stop and be checked before it's allowed through the gate.
