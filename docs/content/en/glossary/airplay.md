## Term Definition

**AirPlay** is Apple’s wireless streaming protocol that allows for screen mirroring or streaming audio/video to an **Apple TV** or AirPlay-enabled display.

In classroom environments, MDM can:

* **Pre-configure permissions** : Specify which Apple TV a specific iPad is allowed to use.
* **Security** : Pre-fill security passwords or set required verification steps.
* **Automation** : Ensure that teachers can present without navigating complex Wi-Fi or Bluetooth settings.

## Analogy

This is the **"Wireless Projector"** feature.

With one tap, a teacher can put their iPad screen up on the big classroom TV. To keep things orderly, IT can pre-program the passwords so teachers can just walk in and start teaching without having to hunt for a cable or ask for a complicated setup.
