## Term Definition

**Wi-Fi 7** (IEEE 802.11be) is the cutting-edge wireless standard designed for extremely high throughput and low latency.

Key innovations for education:

- **320MHz Channels** : Doubles the bandwidth of Wi-Fi 6E, offering massive capacity for 8K video and AR/VR classrooms.
- **Multi-Link Operation (MLO)** : Allows a device (like an iPhone 16) to connect to multiple bands (e.g., 5GHz and 6GHz)_simultaneously_ to send and receive data. This dramatically reduces latency and connection drops.
- **4K QAM** : Packs 20% more data into each signal transmission for higher peak speeds.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Multi-Lane Superhighway."** Previous Wi-Fi was like a car that could only drive in one lane at a time. If that lane got jammed, you slowed down.

Wi-Fi 7 with **MLO** is like a futuristic car that can drive on the Local Road (2.4GHz), the Highway (5GHz), and the Express Lane (6GHz) **all at the same time** . It splits your data across all empty lanes so you never get stuck in traffic, making it perfect for real-time virtual reality lessons.
