## Term Definition

* **Wi-Fi 7**(IEEE 802.11be) is the cutting-edge wireless standard designed for extremely high throughput and low latency.

Key innovations for education:

* **320 MHz Channels**: Doubles the bandwidth of Wi-Fi 6E, offering massive capacity for 8K video and AR/VR classrooms.
* **Multi-Link Operation (MLO)**: Allows a device (like an iPhone 16) to connect to multiple bands (e.g., 5 GHz and 6 GHz)**simultaneously** to send and receive data. This dramatically reduces latency and connection drops.
* **4K QAM**: Packs 20% more data into each signal transmission for higher peak speeds.

## Analogy

Think of this as a**"Multi-Lane Superhighway."**

Previous Wi-Fi was like a car that could only drive in one lane at a time. If that lane got jammed, you slowed down.

Wi-Fi 7 with**MLO**is like a futuristic car that can drive on the Local Road (2.4 GHz), the Highway (5 GHz), and the Express Lane (6 GHz)**all at the same time**. It splits your data across all empty lanes so you never get stuck in traffic, making it perfect for real-time virtual reality lessons.
