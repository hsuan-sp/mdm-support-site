## Term Definition

**AirDrop** is Apple’s proprietary peer-to-peer wireless file-sharing service. It uses **Bluetooth** for discovery and creates a high-speed **Wi-Fi Direct** connection for the actual transfer.

Management considerations:

* **Collaboration** : Excellent for quick document sharing in classrooms.
* **Security Risks** : Can be used for unsolicited or unauthorized file transfers.
* **Restrictions** : MDM can restrict AirDrop to **"Managed Contacts Only"** or disable it entirely to maintain a safe learning environment.

## Analogy

This is **"Wireless Hand-to-Hand"** file transfer.

You don't need a cable or a USB drive; if two devices are close enough, you can "throw" a file from one to the other instantly. It’s perfect for sharing a project with a classmate.

However, if not managed, it could lead to students accidentally sharing distracting files with people nearby.
