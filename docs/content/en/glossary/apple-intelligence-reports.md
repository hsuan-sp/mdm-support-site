## Term Definition

** Apple Intelligence Reports ** (and associated AI Management tools) provide auditing and restriction capabilities within MDM to maintain academic integrity.

Administrators can use MDM to:

* ** Disable Summaries ** : Turn off AI-generated summaries in Safari, Mail, and Messages.
* ** Writing Tools Control ** : Restrict the use of AI for rewriting or proofreading.
* ** Auditing ** : Monitor the availability of AI features across the device fleet.

This ensures students are reading, synthesizing, and writing content based on their own comprehension rather than relying on automated assistance.

## Analogy

This is a mechanism to prevent ** "AI Plagiarism." ** Just as a teacher might require a student to write their own book report rather than copying from an older sibling, MDM can turn off the "AI Summarize" button. This ensures that students are actually reading the full text and learning to express their own thoughts.
