## Term Definition

A ** Captive Portal ** is a web-based authentication page that intercepts network traffic before granting full internet access.

Common characteristics:

* ** Locations ** : Frequently used in hotels, airports, coffee shops, and public transportation.
* ** Interactions ** : Users are prompted to enter credentials, pay a fee, or simply click "Agree" to terms of service.
* ** MDM Impact ** : Managed devices may fail to check in or complete background enrollment tasks when blocked by a Captive Portal until a user manually interacts with the login page.

## Analogy

Think of this as a ** "Security Questionnaire at the Front Door." ** Before you can enter the coffee shop's Wi-Fi "building," you have to answer a few questions or sign a visitor log.

For school iPads, these portals can be a hurdle because the device can't "talk" to its school server until a person manually fills out that questionnaire on the screen.
