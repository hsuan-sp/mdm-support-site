## Term Definition

The **Device Name** is a "friendly" text identifier assigned to a piece of hardware within an MDM environment.

Management features:

- **Identification** : IT can remotely set these names (e.g., `iPad-STUDENT-001`) to quickly identify hardware in a management portal.

- **Visibility** : The name appears in settings, but it is also visible on the local network via **AirDrop** and **Bonjour** lists.
- **Locking** : MDM can prevent students from changing the name themselves, ensuring consistent tracking across the school.

## Analogy

This is the device's **"Digital Name Tag."** Just as a school might require students to wear a uniform with a name badge, IT can remotely "label" every iPad with the student's name and ID.

If someone finds a lost iPad in the library, they can just see the name on the screen and know exactly who to return it to, without needing to check complicated serial numbers or "social security" codes.
