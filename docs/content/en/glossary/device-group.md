## Term Definition

A **Device Group** is a logical container within an MDM console used to categorize and target sets of hardware for management.

Groups are categorized into two types:

- **Static Groups** : Devices are manually added or removed by an administrator. These are useful for fixed sets like "iPad Cart A" or "Board Member MacBooks."
- **Smart Groups** : Devices move in or out automatically based on criteria (e.g., "All devices running iOS 17" or "iPads with less than 5GB storage").

Groups are the primary target for deploying apps, profiles, and remote commands.

## Analogy

Think of this as the school's **"Classroom System."**

- A **Static Group** is like a fixed class list where students stay in the same room all year.
- A **Smart Group** is like an **"Advanced Math Club"** —students automatically "join" as soon as they get a high grade (or update their system), and they automatically "leave" the club if they no longer meet the requirements.

This allows IT to manage devices based on their current status without manual checking.
