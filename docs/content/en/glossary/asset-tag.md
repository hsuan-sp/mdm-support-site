## Term Definition

An **Asset Tag** is a unique identifier assigned by an organization for internal property management and tracking purposes.

MDM interaction with Asset Tags:

* **Digital Assignment** : MDM can write this organization-specific number into the device’s system information.
* **Visibility** : The tag can be forced to display on the **Lock Screen** or the Login window.
* **Inventory** : Facilitates physical audits and cross-referencing between the MDM database and physical hardware.

## Analogy

This is a **"Digital Property Sticker."** Just like a school might put a physical barcode sticker on the back of a laptop, the MDM puts a digital version of that sticker right on the screen.

If an iPad is lost, anyone who finds it can see the **"Asset ID: A-101"** tag on the Lock Screen and return it to the correct department without ever having to unlock the device or check the serial number.
