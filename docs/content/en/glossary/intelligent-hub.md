## Definition

Intelligent Hub is the user-facing application for VMware Workspace ONE. While this is a different platform than the Jamf ecosystem used at TES, the concept is identical to **Jamf Self Service** . It serves as a centralized "Productivity Portal" where students and staff can install approved school software, check their device compliance status, and receive important technical notifications from the IT department.

## Plain English

This is the "School Productivity App." Just as Jamf has "Self Service," this app acts as a private, school-only store. If you need a new app for a class, you don't go to the regular public App Store—you open this "Hub" and download the specific tools the school has provided for you.
