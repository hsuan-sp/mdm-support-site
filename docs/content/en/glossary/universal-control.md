## Term Definition

**Universal Control** is a Continuity feature that allows a single keyboard and mouse to control multiple nearby Apple devices.

Functionality:

- **Zero Setup** : Devices signed into the same iCloud account automatically detect each other.

- **Cross-Platform** : A cursor can move from a Mac screen onto an iPad screen seamlessly.
- **Drag & Drop** : Files can be dragged from one device to another.
- **MDM Control** : Schools often disable this on shared or lab computers to prevent students from accidentally (or intentionally) moving files between machines during exams.

## Analogy

Think of this as **"Cursor Teleportation."** If you place your iPad next to your Mac, your mouse has the superpower to **glide right off the edge** of the computer screen and appear instantly on the iPad screen.

You can even grab a photo from your iPad and drag it onto your Mac to paste it into a report. It makes your two separate devices feel like one giant, powerful workspace.
