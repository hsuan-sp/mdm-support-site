## Term Definition

** AppleCare+ ** is Apple’s official extended warranty and accidental damage insurance service for hardware.

Key benefits for organizations:

* ** Extended Support ** : Extends the standard 1-year limited warranty and provides 24/7 priority access to Apple experts.
* ** Accidental Coverage ** : Covers repairs for "accidental damage" (such as cracked screens or liquid spills) for a set deductible per incident.
* ** Fleet Management ** : Purchasing AppleCare+ for a device fleet is a vital strategy for predictable budgeting and maintaining hardware longevity.

## Analogy

Think of this as ** "Original Equipment Insurance." ** While every device comes with a basic 1-year guarantee, AppleCare+ goes much further. If an iPad is accidentally dropped in the hallway and the screen shatters, the school doesn't have to buy a whole new device.

Instead, they pay a small ** "Processing Fee" ** and Apple repairs or replaces the iPad with a fresh one, keeping the fleet healthy and operational.
