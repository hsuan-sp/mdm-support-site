## Term Definition

**Blueprints** are an advanced automation framework within Jamf management tools used to maintain device consistency.

Key features:

* **Desired State** : Administrators define exactly how a device should be configured (apps, settings, security).
* **Continuous Monitoring** : The system periodically checks if the device matches the defined state.
* **Self-Healing** : If a device drifts from this standard (e.g., an app is removed), the Blueprint automatically triggers a corrective action.

This proactive mechanism ensures that devices remain compliant with the organization's security baseline without manual intervention.

## Analogy

Think of this as **"Autopilot Mode"** for computer management.

You set the destination (e.g., "This device must always have the security app and disk encryption turned on"), and the system automatically keeps the device on track.

If the device **"veers off course"** because someone changed a setting, the Blueprint pulls it back into alignment instantly, without IT needing to step in.
