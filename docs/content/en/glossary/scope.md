## Term Definition

In device management, **Scope** refers to the defined set of targets (users or devices) that will receive a specific policy, app, or configuration.

A scope is built using three logic gates:

* **Targets** : Who*should* get it? (e.g., "All Grades 9-12").
* **Limitations** : Specific subsets required (e.g., "Only users in the Art Department").
* **Exclusions** : Who should*definitely not* get it? (e.g., "Exclude the 'Lost/Stolen' device group").

Correct scoping is the most critical skill for an MDM administrator to prevent accidents (like wiping the wrong iPads).

## Analogy

This is the **"Invite List"** for a party.

Just as you might say, **"Invite everyone in the soccer club (Target), but only the ones who live in Taipei (Limitation), and definitely do NOT invite John (Exclusion),"** Scope is exactly how IT decides who gets the new app and who doesn't.

It ensures the right tools end up in the right hands without cluttering everyone else's screen.
