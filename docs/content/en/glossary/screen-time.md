## Term Definition

**Screen Time** is Apple's built-in framework for monitoring device usage and setting digital boundaries.

MDM capabilities:

* **Downtime** : Scheduling specific blocks of time (e.g., School Hours: 8 AM - 3 PM) where only educational apps are allowed.
* **App Limits** : Setting daily time allowances for specific categories (e.g., "Social Networking").
* **Content Usage** : Providing reports to parents and teachers on how much time a student spends in productivity apps versus games.
* **Communication Safety** : Filtering inappropriate content in Messages.

## Analogy

Screen Time is like a **"Classroom Concentration Assistant."** It helps students understand how they are spending their digital time. If the school wants to ensure students aren't distracted by social media during lunch or playing games after bedtime, the school can set **"Quiet Hours"** standards to help promote a healthy digital-life balance automatically.
