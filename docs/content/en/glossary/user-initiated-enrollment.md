## Term Definition

** User-Initiated Enrollment (UIE) ** is a voluntary onboarding workflow for Apple devices.

Characteristics:

* ** Trigger ** : The user manually visits an enrollment URL or scans a QR code.
* ** Ownership ** : Often implies the device is "User Owned" (BYOD), though sometimes used for organization-owned devices that were not purchased via Apple/Reseller channels.
* ** Supervision ** : By default, UIE devices are ** not ** Supervised (unless enrolled via Apple Configurator).
* ** Control ** : The user retains the ability to remove the MDM profile (and thus unenroll the device) at any time. ** Education Context ** : Generally not recommended for student-owned 1:1 programs because students can easily remove the management profile to bypass restrictions.

## Analogy

This is a ** "Voluntary Enrollment Plan." ** Instead of the school "drafting" the iPad into service automatically (the ADE method), the student chooses to sign up for school management themselves.

However, because it's voluntary, the student can also choose to ** "quit" ** the plan at any time, meaning the school’s security rules will stop working the moment they decide to leave.
