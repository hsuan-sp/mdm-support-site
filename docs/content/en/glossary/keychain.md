## Term Definition

The **Keychain** is Apple’s integrated password management system included in macOS, iOS, and iPadOS.

Stored items include:

* **Credentials** : Usernames and passwords for websites, servers, and apps.
* **Certificates** : Digital identities used for Wi-Fi (802.1X) and VPN authentication.
* **Encryption** : Private keys used for secure communication.
* **Secure Notes** : Confidential information entered by the user.

Once a user logs in to their device, the Keychain automatically unlocks, providing seamless authentication across the system without requiring constant re-entry of passwords.

## Analogy

Think of this as the system's **"Universal Key Ring"** or **"Secure Lockbox."** You don't have to carry around dozens of individual keys (your passwords) in your pocket; you just keep them all in this secure, encrypted box (the Keychain).

Once you unlock the box with your fingerprint or startup password, the system automatically reaches in and grabs whichever specific key you need to unlock a website or the school Wi-Fi, so you don't even have to think about it.
