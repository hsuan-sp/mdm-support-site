## Term Definition

** Recovery Lock ** is a hardware-level security feature for Mac computers with Apple Silicon.

Functionality:

* ** Block ** : Prevents users from entering macOS Recovery Mode unless they have authorization.
* ** Requirement ** : Users must enter a predefined password (managed by MDM) to access tools like Disk Utility or Terminal in the recovery environment.
* ** Goal ** : Stops students or thieves from wiping the Mac, disabling security settings (like SIP), or downgrading the OS to bypass management.

## Analogy

Think of this as a ** "Digital Lock on the ER Door." ** In the past, anyone could take a computer that wasn't working to the "Emergency Room" (Recovery Mode) and reset everything to factory settings.

Now, the ER door has a keypad. Without the secret code from IT, a thief can't even "reinstall" the computer to erase their tracks, making a stolen school Mac useless to them.
