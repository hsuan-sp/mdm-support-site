## Term Definition

In a device management context, **Inventory** refers to the comprehensive database containing the current state of every organizational hardware and software asset.

Key inventory data points:

* **Hardware details** : Serial number, model, processor type, and total RAM.
* **Software details** : Current OS version and a list of all installed applications.
* **Security status** : Encryption status (FileVault/Activation Lock), security patch level, and passcode compliance.
* **Network status** : Current IP address, MAC address, and last check-in time.
* **User assignment** : Which specific student or staff member is the primary user of the hardware.

This centralized record is essential for IT teams to perform security audits, plan for hardware refresh cycles, and provide fast technical support.

## Analogy

This is the school IT's **"Central Asset Registry"** or **"Master List."** Just as a school library keeps a detailed list of every book it owns, where it's shelved, and who has currently borrowed it, the IT inventory is a centralized record of every iPad and Mac in the school.

It tells IT exactly where each device is, how old it is, and whether it's "healthy" or needs a repair, making it much easier to ensure every student has the tools they need to succeed.
