## Term Definition

A **Package (.pkg)** is the standard flat-file installation format for macOS software deployment.

Components:

* **Payload** : The actual files (apps, fonts, scripts) to be installed.
* **Scripts** : "Pre-install" and "Post-install" scripts that run commands to set up the environment (e.g., activate a license key).
* **Receipts** : A record left on the Mac so the system knows what was installed. **MDM Usage** : Admins wrap complex software (like Microsoft Office or Adobe Creative Cloud) into PKG files to deploy them silently to thousands of Macs at once.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Digital IKEA Box."** It doesn't just contain the furniture (the software); it also includes the tools and an **"Instruction Manual"** (scripts) for the computer.

When the school sends this box to a Mac, the Mac opens it, reads the manual, and puts every piece in exactly the right place automatically—building the furniture while the student is busy doing something else.
