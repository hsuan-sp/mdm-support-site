## Definition

iPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service) is a suite of cloud services that enables organizations to integrate disparate applications, data sources, and business processes. In an enterprise environment, MDM systems can leverage iPaaS to connect with other management systems (such as HR databases or ERP software) to automate workflows, like automatically creating a user account when a new staff member is hired.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Universal Adapter" for the digital world. A large organization like a school uses many different types of software that don't always speak the same language. iPaaS acts as a "Middleman" that translates between them, allowing the IT system to automatically talk to the HR system without a human having to type the data twice.
