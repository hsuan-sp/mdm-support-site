## Term Definition

**Managed Classes** are pedagogical groupings defined within the MDM or synchronized from Apple School Manager.

Data structure includes:

* **Roster** : A list of student Managed Apple IDs and their assigned devices.
* **Instructors** : The teacher(s) authorized to manage these specific students.
* **Schedule** : Timeframes when the class is active (optional).
* **Automation** : This data automatically populates the **Apple Classroom** app, allowing teachers to view screens and launch apps for their students without manual setup.

## Analogy

Think of this as your **"Digital Class Register."** When a teacher walks into a room and opens the Apple Classroom app, the system has already organized everything: the names of the 30 students for that specific period and their iPad connection details are all loaded and ready to go.

The teacher operates the "dashboard" to instantly have the whole class open a textbook or check if anyone is playing a game, without having to manually type in serial numbers or names.
