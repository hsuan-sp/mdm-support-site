## Term Definition

**Apple Intelligence** is the personal intelligence system introduced by Apple in **2024 (OS version 18)** and further advanced in **2025 (OS version 26)** . It utilizes on-device large language models (LLMs) to power generative AI features.

Key features include:

* **Writing Tools** : Proofreading, rewriting, and summarization of text.
* **Visual Intelligence** : Genmoji (custom emojis) and Image Playground (image generation).
* **Mail & Messages** : Notification prioritization and smart replies.

**Technical Specifications** :

* **Privacy** : Most processing occurs locally on-device. Complex tasks use **Private Cloud Compute (PCC)** without storing data.
* **Hardware Requirements** : Requires devices with **M-series** chips (M1 or later) or **A17 Pro** chips and later.

## MDM Context

Organizations can choose to fully enable or disable Apple Intelligence via MDM. In education, it is highly recommended to establish strong usage policies—especially during exams, where "Writing Tools" should be disabled to prevent academic dishonesty.

Entry-level iPads (9th/10th Gen) do not support these features.

## Analogy

Think of it as a **"Private Assistant"** living inside your iPad.

It can help you rewrite an essay, summarize a long email, or even create a custom emoji, all while keeping your data strictly on your device so no one else can see it. It's like having a brilliant helper who is sworn to secrecy.
