## Term Definition

An **Activation Lock Bypass Code** is a unique alphanumeric string that an MDM server automatically collects from **Supervised** devices.

This code is essential for device lifecycle management:

- If a user leaves the organization without signing out of their personal **Apple Account** (leaving the device "locked").
- An IT administrator can enter this specific code in the password field to bypass the lock.
- This allows the device to be erased and prepared for a new user.

## Analogy

This is the **"Emergency Override Key"** for institution-owned hardware.

If someone leaves the school and forgets to unlock their iPad, IT doesn't have to guess the student's personal password. They can pull this code from the MDM system, enter it into the device, and the "theft lock" is instantly removed. The iPad can then be wiped and given to a new student.
