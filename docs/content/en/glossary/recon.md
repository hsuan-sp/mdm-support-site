## Term Definition

** Recon ** (short for the `Jamf recon` command) is the inventory collection process on managed Macs.

What it collects:

* ** Hardware ** : Model, serial number, battery health, and storage capacity.
* ** Software ** : List of all installed applications and their versions.
* ** Identity ** : Current logged-in user and local account lists.
* ** Custom Data ** : Results from any scripts defined as "Extension Attributes" (e.g., checking if SSH is enabled).

Running `sudo Jamf recon` in Terminal forces the Mac to submit this report immediately.

## Analogy

Think of this as an ** "Instant Health Checkup." ** Normally, a computer might only send its status report once a day.

If you run the "Recon" command, you're telling the Mac to ** "Stop everything, count your apps, check your storage, and tell the main office how you are feeling right now!" ** It ensures IT has the absolute latest information to help fix a problem.
