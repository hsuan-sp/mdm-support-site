## Term Definition

**Find My** is Apple’s distributed tracking and recovery network for hardware and accessories.

Organizational capabilities:

* **Managed Lost Mode** : MDM can remotely trigger a specialized "Lost Mode" on supervised devices. This locks the interface, displays a custom message, and provides coordinates to the IT department.
* **Activation Lock Bypass** : Even if a student signs in with a personal iCloud account, MDM can generate a bypass code to prevent the device from being "locked" to that student's account after a wipe.
* **Independence** : Managed Lost Mode does not require the device to be signed into a personal iCloud account to function.

## Analogy

This is the device's **"Built-in GPS Tracker"** and **"Loud Siren."** If a student leaves their iPad on a park bench, IT can immediately see exactly where it is on a satellite map. They can even make it play a loud "beeping" sound (even if it's on silent) or put an unmissable message on the screen saying, "This iPad belongs to the school. Please return it."

If it's truly gone, IT can remotely **"Self-Destruct"** all the data to keep it private.
