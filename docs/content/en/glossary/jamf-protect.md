## Definition

Jamf Protect is a specialized endpoint security solution built specifically for the Mac. It uses Apple's native ** Endpoint Security Framework ** to monitor for malicious behavior, provide real-time threat detection, and automate responses to malware. Because it is built "for Mac, by Jamf," it does not slow down system performance the way traditional cross-platform antivirus software often does, while providing superior visibility into macOS-specific threats.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Professional Bodyguard" that only protects Macs. Most antivirus programs are like heavy, clunky suits of armor that slow the computer down. Jamf Protect is different—it's like a highly trained bodyguard who is invisible and doesn't slow you down, but is always watching for "bad people" (malware) trying to break into your computer. If it sees something suspicious, it acts instantly to keep you safe.
