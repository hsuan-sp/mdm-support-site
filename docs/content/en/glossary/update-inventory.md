## Term Definition

** Update Inventory ** is the standard MDM command that forces a device to refresh its data record on the server.

Data points refreshed:

* ** Device Info ** : OS Version, Battery Level, Storage usage.
* ** Apps ** : List of all installed applications and versions.
* ** Security ** : Current status of Passcode, Encryption, and System Integrity Protection.
* ** Profiles ** : List of installed configuration profiles.

This command is the "heartbeat" of management; if a device hasn't updated its inventory in 30 days, the data on the server is considered stale and unreliable.

## Analogy

Think of this as a ** "Digital Roll Call." ** Just like a teacher needs to scan the room to count the students and check if everyone has their textbooks ready before starting a lesson, the tech office sends this command to ** count all your apps ** and check your iPad's health.

It ensures the school's records are 100% accurate and up-to-date.
