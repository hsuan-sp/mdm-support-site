## Term Definition

**Remote Management** is the specific screen presented by the Setup Assistant on a new Apple device during the **Automated Device Enrollment** process.

Signifies:

- **Detection** : The device has "called home" to Apple and recognized that it belongs to an organization (e.g., specific school).

- **Consent** : The user must click "Next" or "Enroll" to download the MDM profile.
- **Mandate** : If the device is in ADE, this screen is usually mandatory and cannot be skipped, ensuring no device enters the fleet unmanaged.

## Analogy

Remote Management is the **"School’s Digital Stamp."** When you first open a brand new iPad box, this screen is like the device holding up a badge saying: **"I belong to Taipei European School."** It’s the official hand-off where the iPad accepts the school’s rules and begins its life as a managed learning tool.
