## Term Definition

A ** Certificate Authority (CA) ** is a trusted third-party entity or internal service that issues and manages digital certificates used for authentication and encryption.

Operational principles:

* ** Chain of Trust ** : To establish a secure connection, a device must first install and trust the CA’s ** Root Certificate ** .
* ** Validation ** : Once the Root is trusted, the device will automatically accept all other "leaf" certificates (for Wi-Fi, VPN, or email) signed by that specific authority.
* ** Revocation ** : The CA can invalidate certificates if they are compromised, maintaining network integrity.

## Analogy

This is the ** "ID Issuing Office" ** of the internet.

Think of it like a government passport office. Because we trust the office (the CA), we trust any passport (certificate) they stamp and issue.

In a school, the IT department often runs its own private ** "ID Office" ** to give the school's iPads permission to use the campus Wi-Fi without needing a public company's approval.
