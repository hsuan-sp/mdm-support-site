## Term Definition

**Recovery Mode** is a special boot partition on Apple devices designed for emergency maintenance and troubleshooting.

Available tools:

- **Disk Utility** : Repair or erase the hard drive.

- **Reinstall macOS** : Download and install a fresh copy of the operating system.
- **Restore from Backup** : Recover data from a Time Machine backup.
- **Terminal** : Advanced command-line tools for fixing system errors.
- **Security Utility** : Change startup security policies (e.g., allow booting from external drives).

## Analogy

Think of this as the **"Emergency Operating Room."** If your computer gets so "sick" that it can't even start up normally, you boot it into this special mode.

Here, the **"Doctors"** (the built-in tools) can perform surgery on its hard drive or completely transplant its brain (reinstall the OS) to get it working like new again. It’s the final safety net for fixing a broken device.
