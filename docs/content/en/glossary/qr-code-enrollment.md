## Term Definition

**QR Code Enrollment**is a streamlined method for enrolling mobile devices into an MDM environments.

The process:

* **Scan**: The user points the device camera at a unique QR code provided by IT.
* **Decode**: The device reads the embedded URL and Enrollment token.
* **Connect**: Safari automatically opens to the specific Enrollment portal.
* **Install**: The user is prompted to download and install the MDM Profile immediately.

This reduces typing errors and significantly speeds up "User-Initiated Enrollment" (UIE).

## Analogy

Think of this as**"Scan-to-Check-In."**

Instead of requiring a student to manually type a long, complicated web address like `https://enroll.myschool.edu/manage/enroll` into Safari, they just open the Camera and scan a square code.

All the setup information is automatically filled in, allowing the iPad to start its first day of school instantly without any typing mistakes.
