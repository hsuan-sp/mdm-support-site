## Term Definition

**WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)** is the family of security protocols used to secure wireless networks.

Generations:

* **WPA3 (Latest)** : Mandatory for Wi-Fi 6E. Provides stronger encryption (SAE) and protection against password guessing attacks.
* **WPA2 (Standard)** : The current standard for most devices.
* **Enterprise Mode** : Schools typically use WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise, which authenticates each user individually (via **802.1X** ) rather than using a single shared class password.

## Analogy

Think of these as the **"Different Levels of Locks"** on your school's front door.

* **WPA1** was like a simple latch (too easy to break).
* **WPA2** is like a strong deadbolt lock.
* **WPA3** is the newest **"Smart Lock"** that is nearly impossible for a thief to pick.

The school uses these high-level locks to make sure only students and teachers can get onto the school Wi-Fi, keeping everyone's data safe.
