## Definition

The Jamf Pro API (specifically the Pro API v2) is a developer interface that allows IT administrators to automate management tasks via code. Instead of manually clicking through the web interface, administrators can use scripts to perform bulk operations—such as creating hundreds of policies at once, importing large lists of devices, or generating custom reports. It enables a high level of efficiency and integration with other school systems.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Remote Control" for the school's management system. Instead of an IT person having to manually click a button 500 times to set up 500 iPads, they can use the "Remote Control" (the API) to do it all with a single command. It saves a massive amount of time and ensures that everything is set up perfectly without any human errors.
