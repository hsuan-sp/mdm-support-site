## Term Definition

A **Universal Binary** is a macOS application package that contains executable code for multiple processor architectures.

Structure:

* **Fat Binary** : It includes code for both **Intel** (x86_64) and **Apple Silicon** (ARM64) chips inside a single app file.
* **Workflow** : When the user double-clicks the app, macOS automatically chooses the correct code for the computer's chip.
* **Benefit** : Ensures the app runs at maximum native speed on an M3 MacBook Air*and*an old Intel iMac, without needing **Rosetta 2** .

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Bilingual Book."** Instead of buying one book in English and another in French, you buy one book that has every page written in both languages side-by-side.

If you are an English reader (Apple Silicon), you just read the English parts. If you are a French reader (Intel), you read the French parts. It works perfectly for everyone without needing a translator.
