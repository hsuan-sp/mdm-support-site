## Term Definition

** Jamf School ** is a specialized MDM solution tailored explicitly for the K-12 educational landscape.

Focus areas:

* ** Ease of Use ** : A simplified interface designed to be managed by educators or dedicated IT staff with less engineering experience than Jamf Pro requires.
* ** Teacher Tools ** : Includes the ** Jamf Teacher ** app, which gives classroom teachers direct, simple control over student iPads during their lessons.
* ** Integration ** : Deeply synchronized with ** Apple School Manager (ASM) ** for easy roster and class management.
* ** Parental Control ** : Includes a parent-facing app to extend management logic to the home environment.

## Analogy

Think of this as the ** "Education Edition" ** of the management software.

While the "Professional" version (Jamf Pro) is built for systems engineers managing thousands of computers, ** Jamf School ** is built for teachers and school staff.

It makes it easy for a teacher to manage a classroom of 30 iPads without needing a degree in computer science, while still giving the school all the security and control it needs to keep students safe.
