## Term Definition

**Ethernet** is the standard technology for wired local area network (LAN) connections, typically utilizing **RJ45** cables.

Deployment advantages:

* **Stability** : Provides a consistent connection unaffected by radio interference or physical obstacles that impact Wi-Fi.
* **Speed** : Offers significantly higher throughput for massive data tasks.
* **IT Labs** : Recommended for initial "Zero-Touch" provisioning, bulk software installations, and multi-gigabit OS updates where Wi-Fi congestion could lead to failures.

## Analogy

Think of Ethernet as a **"High-Speed Private Train Track."** Wi-Fi is like driving on a busy public highway—it's convenient and mobile, but it can get congested with traffic or lose signal in tunnels. **Ethernet** is a direct, solid, and dedicated line that is much faster and more reliable. It ensures that when the school is updating 100 iPads at once, the internet doesn't "stutter" or drop out, delivering the data directly to each station without delays.
