## Term Definition

**DDM App Management** is a modernized method for deploying and governing applications using the **Declarative Device Management** (DDM) framework.

Key differences from legacy MDM:

* **Device Agency** : The device itself takes full responsibility for handling downloads and managing installation retries.
* **Auto-Correction** : If a required managed app is accidentally deleted by a user, the device detects the discrepancy locally and automatically re-installs it.
* **Efficiency** : Eliminates the need for the MDM server to constantly monitor and resend installation commands.

This ensures that critical learning tools are always present on the device without administrative overhead.

## Analogy

Think of this as an **"Automatic Restocking"** system for your apps.

It’s like a smart vending machine that knows exactly what should be on each shelf. If someone takes an app off the "shelf" (deletes it), the machine immediately sees the empty spot and puts a new one back right away, ensuring the students always have the tools they need.
