## Term Definition

**Apple Pencil** is an active stylus designed specifically for supported iPad models. It features high precision, low latency, and pressure sensitivity.

In specialized assessment or highly controlled classroom scenarios, MDM can be used to:

- **Restrict Bluetooth** : Disable the connection to the stylus entirely.

- **Limit Gestures** : Restrict specific inputs like the **"Double-Tap"** feature (on Apple Pencil 2 and later) to prevent distractions.
- **Standardize Input** : Ensure a uniform writing experience during digital exams.

## Analogy

This is the **"High-Tech Pencil"** for the iPad.

In addition to writing, it has electronic features—like tapping the side of the pen to change to an eraser. During an exam, the school can **"lock"** these digital features, turning it back into a standard pencil that can only write. This prevents any unfair advantages or accidental distractions.
