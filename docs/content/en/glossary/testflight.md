## Term Definition

**TestFlight** is Apple's platform for beta testing pre-release applications.

Workflow:

1. **Invite** : Developers send an email invitation or public link to testers.

2. **Install** : Testers download the TestFlight app to install the beta version of the software.

3. **Feedback** : Testers can take screenshots or send crash reports directly to the developer from within the app.

4. **Expiry** : Beta builds typically expire after 90 days.

This is useful for schools piloting new ed-tech apps before deploying them to the entire student body.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Sneak Peek Movie Screening."** Before a movie (an app) comes out in theaters (the App Store), the filmmakers might show a **"work-in-progress"** version to a small group of fans to get their advice.

TestFlight is the **"private theater"** where students and teachers can try out new educational tools and help fix the bugs before the app is released to the whole world.
