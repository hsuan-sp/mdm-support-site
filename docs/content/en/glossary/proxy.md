## Term Definition

A **Proxy Server** acts as an intermediary gateway between a user's device and the internet.

Functions:

* **Filtering** : Inspects URL requests and blocks dangerous or inappropriate content before it reaches the device.
* **Caching** : Stores copies of frequently accessed websites (e.g., the school homepage) to speed up loading times for everyone.
* **Anonymity** : Hides the internal IP structure of the school network from the public internet.
* **Logging** : Keeps a record of which websites are accessed by which user for accountability.

## Analogy

Think of a Proxy as a **"Personal Shopper"** for the internet.

Instead of you going directly to a store (a website) yourself, you hand a shopping list to your device, which gives it to the **Personal Shopper** (the Proxy).

They go out, verify the store is safe, buy the item, and bring it back to you. This ensures that no "forbidden items" are brought onto campus because the shopper checks everything first.
