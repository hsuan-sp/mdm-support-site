## Term Definition

A **Smart Group** is a dynamic collection of devices in Jamf Pro that updates automatically based on live criteria.

How it works:

- **Criteria** : Admin sets a rule (e.g., "OS Version is less than 17.0" OR "Battery Level is less than 20%").

- **Automation** : The MDM constantly checks inventory reports.
- **Membership** : If a device matches the rule, it is instantly added to the group. If it updates and no longer matches, it is removed.
- **Action** : These groups are used to trigger policies (e.g., "Update OS" policy targets the "Old OS" Smart Group).

## Analogy

A Smart Group is an **"Automatic Sorting Bin."** You set a rule: **"If a student iPad has less than 10% battery, put it in the 'Needs Charge' list."** The system constantly checks every device; as soon as one drops to 9%, it’s moved to that list automatically. No one has to check manually.
