## Term Definition

**Zero-Wipe MDM Migration** is a transition feature in iOS/iPadOS and macOS that allows devices to switch MDM servers without erasing user data.

Mechanism (Declarative Device Management):

1. **Unenroll** : The device gracefully leaves the old MDM server.

2. **Transfer** : It retains user data (photos, files) and apps.

3. **Re-enroll** : It immediately enrolls into the *new* MDM server designated in Apple School Manager.

4. **Takeover** : The new server takes ownership of the existing managed apps.

**Warning for Schools** : While promising, this process can be risky for **Shared iPads** or devices with complex profiles, often leading to "zombie" apps that cannot be updated.

## Analogy

In the past, switching to a new management system was like **"tearing down a house and rebuilding it"** just to change the landlord.

Now, **Zero-Wipe Migration** is like **"keeping your house and furniture exactly as is, but just hiring a new security guard."** All your photos and homework stay on the iPad, but the school gets to manage it using a newer, better system.
