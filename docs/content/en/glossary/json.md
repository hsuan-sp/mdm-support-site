## Definition

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. In MDM, JSON is frequently used to write advanced configuration schemas or to transmit data between systems via APIs. Its structure is based on "Key-Value pairs."

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Digital Standard Form." It’s a very organized way for computer systems to send information to each other. For example, instead of a messy paragraph, a system sends: `{ "Name": "Student A", "Grade": 5 }`. Because the format is always the same, the receiving computer knows exactly where to find each piece of information without making mistakes.
