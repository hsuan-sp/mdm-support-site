## Definition

iPhone Mirroring is a continuity feature introduced in macOS 15 that allows users to view and fully interact with their iPhone directly on their Mac screen. While highly productive, MDM administrators can disable this feature on shared school hardware to prevent personal data leakage or to ensure that users are not bypassing Mac-level security monitoring software by performing tasks within the mirrored iPhone window.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Virtual Smartphone" inside your computer. You can use your phone apps and send texts right from your Mac screen. However, because this can show personal photos and messages on a school computer, or allow someone to work in a "hidden window" that the school's safety software can't see, IT may choose to turn this feature off on certain computers to keep everyone safe.
