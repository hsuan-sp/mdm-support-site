## Term Definition

The ** Network Extension URL Filtering API ** is a modern, privacy-preserving framework in iOS and macOS for content filtering.

Key advantages over legacy VPNs:

* ** Performance ** : Filtering happens directly on the device's network stack, eliminating the bottleneck of routing traffic through a tunnel.
* ** Privacy ** : The API evaluates web requests (URLs) without needing to decrypt the actual data packets (SSL Inspection), maintaining user privacy.
* ** Selective Blocking ** : Used by tools like ** Jamf Safe Internet ** to instantly block specific categories (e.g., Gambling) while allowing everything else to flow freely.

## Analogy

Previously, school web filtering was like a ** "Security Checkpoint" ** where every single car (piece of data) had to stop and be searched, which made traffic very slow.

This new technology is like a ** "Smart GPS" ** built inside every car.

The car itself knows which "roads" (websites) are dangerous and simply ** refuses to turn down those streets ** . This makes the internet faster and saves battery because the car just drives normally without waiting in line at a checkpoint.
