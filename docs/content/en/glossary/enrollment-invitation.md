## Term Definition

An **Enrollment Invitation** is a semi-automated method for adding existing or personal devices to the Jamf management system.

The typical process:

1. **Creation** : An administrator generates a unique invitation in the MDM console.

2. **Delivery** : The invitation is sent to the user via email, SMS, or displayed as a QR code.

3. **Execution** : The user clicks the link or scans the code, which directs them to a secure portal to install the management profile manually.

This method is primarily used for **User Enrollment (BYOD)** or for enrolling devices that were not purchased through official Apple corporate channels.

## Analogy

Think of this as a **"Digital Golden Ticket."** The school sends you a special, unique link. Once you click it, your personal device is "invited" to join the school's private network.

This allows you to get school services (like Wi-Fi and apps) automatically. However, because it's an invitation **you accepted** , the school still can't see your personal data, like photos or text messages.
