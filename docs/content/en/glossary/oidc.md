## Term Definition

** OpenID Connect (OIDC) ** is a modern identity authentication protocol built on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework.

Key features:

* ** Standard ** : Used by major providers like Google, Microsoft, and Okta.
* ** Workflow ** : It allows a client (like an iPad or Jamf Connect) to verify the identity of a user based on authentication performed by an authorization server.
* ** Tokens ** : Instead of sending actual passwords back and forth, it uses secure "ID Tokens," reducing the risk of password theft.
* ** MFA ** : Natively supports Multi-Factor Authentication workflows.

## Analogy

Think of this as the ** "Global Digital Passport" ** for the internet.

Instead of having to create a new name and password for every single school website or app, OIDC is the technology that lets you use your one ** "Official ID" ** (your Google or Microsoft account).

Once you show your ID once, you get a ** "Visitor's Badge" ** (a Token) that lets you walk into all the school's other "Digital Rooms" without having to stop and show your ID card again at every single door.
