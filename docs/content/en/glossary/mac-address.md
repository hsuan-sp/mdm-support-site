## Term Definition

A ** MAC Address ** (Media Access Control Address) is the unique hardware identifier assigned to a network interface (Wi-Fi or Ethernet card).

Privacy developments:

* ** Hardware MAC ** : The permanent, physical ID burned into the chip.
* ** Private Wi-Fi Address ** : A feature where the device generates a ** randomized ** MAC address for each Wi-Fi network it joins. This prevents tracking across different locations (e.g., a coffee shop cannot see that the same device visited yesterday). ** MDM Impact ** : Schools often need to disable "Private Wi-Fi Address" on their internal networks so they can reliably identify and filter specific devices.

## Analogy

Think of this as the ** "Fingerprint" ** of your device's Wi-Fi card.

Technically, every device has a unique fingerprint. However, to stop strangers from tracking your movements as you visit different shops, your device now wears ** "Digital Gloves" ** (Private Wi-Fi Address).

Every time you enter a new building, you put on a different pair of gloves, so the network sees a different print and can't trace it back to the real you.
