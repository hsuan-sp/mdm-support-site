## Term Definition

** Automatic Reboot ** is a specialized security configuration introduced in ** OS version 26 ** .

Configuration details:

* ** Trigger ** : MDM can configure a device to automatically reboot after a specific period of inactivity or extended lock time (e.g., 72 hours).
* ** Security Goal ** : The reboot clears sensitive decryption keys from the device’s volatile memory (RAM).
* ** Protection ** : Moving from ** "Before First Unlock" (BFU) ** to a cold-boot state makes the device significantly harder to compromise or decrypt if stolen.

## MDM Context

Schools should use this feature to ensure that lost or stolen devices automatically enter a more secure state. It is important to inform users that these reboots are an intentional security feature and not a hardware fault.

## Analogy

Think of this as a ** "Timed Vault Lock." ** If the vault hasn't been opened for a long time, the security system assumes something might be wrong and automatically adds an extra layer of heavy shielding.

If an iPad is lost and remains locked for several days, it reboots itself to ** "forget" ** any temporary passwords stored in its short-term memory, making it much harder for a thief to break into the data.
