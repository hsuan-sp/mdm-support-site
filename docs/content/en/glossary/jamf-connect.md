## Term Definition

**Jamf Connect** is a security and identity solution designed to synchronize local Mac accounts with cloud-based identity providers.

Key benefits:

* **Unified Login** : Allows users to log in to their Mac using their institutional cloud credentials (e.g., Google Workspace or Microsoft Entra ID).
* **Password Sync** : Ensures that if a user changes their school password online, their Mac login password is automatically updated to match.
* **MFA Enforcement** : Enables Multi-Factor Authentication during the initial setup of a new Mac, significantly improving security.
* **Zero-Touch** : Facilitates the creation of a local user account on-the-fly during the first login.

## Analogy

This is the **"Cloud ID Portal"** for your Mac.

Instead of having a separate, confusing password just for your laptop, **Jamf Connect** lets you log in using your regular school email and password.

It's like having a **"Single Master Key"** —if you change your school password in your browser, your Mac password automatically updates to match, so you only ever have to remember one single set of login details for everything you do at school.
