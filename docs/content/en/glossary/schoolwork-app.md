## Term Definition

**Schoolwork** is an iPad app developed by Apple to streamline the assignment and collection of digital work.

Key features:

- **Handouts** : Teachers can create assignments that include app activities, PDFs, web links, or photos.

- **Deep Linking** : Teachers can direct students to a specific chapter or activity*inside* a compatible educational app (e.g., "Open GeoGebra to Level 3").
- **Progress Tracking** : Provides real-time data to teachers on student progress (e.g., "Time spent," "Quiz score," or "Completion status").
- **Privacy** : Student data is encrypted and visible only to the teacher and the school.

## Analogy

Think of this as the **"Digital Homework Diary and Dropbox."** It’s the central place where teachers post assignments ("Read Chapter 4") and share materials.

Students can submit their finished work directly in the app, and teachers can see who has finished and how everyone is doing, all in one organized dashboard—no more lost papers.
