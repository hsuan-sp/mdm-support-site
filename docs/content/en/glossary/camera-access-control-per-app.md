## Term Definition

A granular MDM restriction key introduced in **OS version 26** (`allowedCameraRestrictionBundleIDs`) that provides precise hardware governance.

Functional capabilities:

* **Granularity** : Allows administrators to grant or deny camera access for specific apps individually.
* **Improved Security** : Replaces the older global "Allow/Disallow Camera" toggle.
* **Privacy Compliance** : Ensures that only approved educational apps can use the camera and microphone, even on a fully managed device.

## MDM Context

In a classroom, IT can allow a specific science app to use the camera for capturing experiments while keeping the camera disabled for social media or distracting apps.

## Analogy

In the past, camera access was like a **"Main Front Door Key"** —it was either all open or all locked.

Now, it's like a **"Hotel Keycard System."** IT can program the card to let you into the "Science Lab" (the classroom app), while simultaneously keeping the "Game Room" (distracting apps) locked, protecting your privacy and focus.
