## Term Definition

** TLS (Transport Layer Security) ** and its predecessor ** SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) ** are the cryptographic protocols that secure internet communications.

Function:

* ** Encryption ** : Scrambles data so it cannot be read by anyone except the sender and receiver.
* ** Identity ** : Uses ** Certificates ** to prove that the server you are talking to is the real one (e.g., verifying that `apple.com` is really Apple).
* ** Usage ** : Critical for MDM commands, Wi-Fi authentication, and secure web browsing (HTTPS).

## Analogy

Think of this as the internet’s ** "Armored Truck." ** When you put a letter (your data) inside, the truck automatically locks it with a code that only the destination bank can open.

This ensures that while the truck (the network) is driving from your house to the bank, no highway robbers can peek inside or change the money in the bags.
