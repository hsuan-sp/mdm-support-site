## Term Definition

** AirDrop for Business ** (also known as ** Managed AirDrop ** ) is a management capability that allows IT administrators to control data flow via AirDrop.

The system distinguishes between:

* ** Managed Storage ** : Organizational apps and data.
* ** Unmanaged Storage ** : Personal apps and data.

IT can prevent users from sharing sensitive school documents with personal devices while still allowing AirDrop for legitimate schoolwork between managed devices.

## Analogy

Think of this as an ** "Information Filter" ** for AirDrop.

The school can set a rule that says: "You can AirDrop files between school iPads, but you are blocked from sending school work to your personal phone." This ensures that homework and sensitive data stay within the school's safe environment.
