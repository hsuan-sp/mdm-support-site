## Term Definition

** App Thinning ** is an Apple optimization technology designed to minimize the storage footprint of applications. It consists of three pillars:

* ** Slicing ** : The system only downloads the specific assets (e.g., graphics for that specific retina scale) required for the target device.
* ** Bitcode ** : Allows Apple to re-optimize an app binary for future hardware updates without the developer resubmitting the app.
* ** On-Demand Resources ** : Allows parts of an app (like advanced levels in a game) to be downloaded only when needed.

This significantly reduces download times and saves precious storage space on student iPads with limited capacity.

## Analogy

Think of this as ** "Custom Tailoring" ** for apps.

Instead of delivering every possible version of an app (for iPad Air, iPad Pro, and Mac mini) to your device, the App Store only sends the parts that actually fit your specific hardware.

It's like buying a shirt in your exact size rather than taking home a giant box containing every size from XS to XL.
