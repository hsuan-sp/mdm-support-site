## Definition

Inventory Collection is the core management process where Jamf Pro gathers detailed information from school devices, including hardware specs, installed apps, system settings, and battery health. While this typically happens automatically once a day, administrators can manually trigger an "Update Inventory" command to get an immediate snapshot of a device's current state. This data is the foundation for all school IT reports and ** Smart Groups ** .

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Daily School Census." Every day, each iPad sends a quick report back to the school headquarters saying, "I have this much battery left," "I am using this version of the system," and "I have these apps installed." It allows IT to make sure all school property is healthy and up-to-date without ever having to touch the physical device.
