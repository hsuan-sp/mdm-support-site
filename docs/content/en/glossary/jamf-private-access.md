## Definition

Jamf Private Access (managed through the ** Jamf Trust ** app) is a Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solution. It ensures that only authorized, secure, and compliant devices can access private school resources. Unlike a traditional VPN that gives a user full access to a network, Private Access creates a "Micro-tunnel" only for the specific apps required, while also checking the "health" of the device before allowing a connection.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Smart Security Gate" for school files. Instead of just checking your ID card at the entrance, this system also checks if you have a fever (if your device has a virus) and if you are wearing the right uniform (if your device follows school security rules). Only if you and your device pass all the checks will the gate open—and even then, it only lets you go to the specific "room" (the app) you need, not the whole building.
