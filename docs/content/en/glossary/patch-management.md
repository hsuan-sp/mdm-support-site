## Term Definition

**Patch Management** is the automated workflow for identifying, distributing, and installing software updates for third-party applications.

Jamf Pro capabilities:

* **Monitoring** : Checks the fleet for vulnerable versions of common software (e.g., Google Chrome, Zoom, Microsoft Office).
* **Automation** : Subscribes to manufacturer feeds to detect when a new version is released.
* **Enforcement** : Automatically pushes the update package to computers that need it, minimizing the "window of vulnerability."
* **Reporting** : Provides real-time dashboards showing exactly which computers are patched and which are still risky.

## Analogy

Think of this as **"Automatic Security Repairs."** When a software company finds a "hole" (a bug) in their program, they release a **"patch"** to fix it.

IT uses Patch Management to make sure that as soon as a fix is available, it is automatically applied to every computer in the school. It’s like having a maintenance team that automatically fixes every leaky pipe in school the moment it's found, without you having to call them.
