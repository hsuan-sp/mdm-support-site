## Term Definition

**Window App** is the advanced windowing environment introduced in iPadOS 26, evolving from Stage Manager.

Capabilities:

- **Floating Windows** : Apps can be resized, overlapped, and moved freely, similar to macOS.

- **Grouping** : Users can create "App Pairs" or workspaces (e.g., Safari + Notes for research) that are saved together.
- **External Display** : Full support for extending the desktop to a monitor (up to 6K) rather than just mirroring, effectively turning the iPad into a desktop workstation.

## Analogy

In the past, using apps on an iPad was like **"reading one book at a time"** on your lap.

With **Window App** , using your iPad is like sitting at a **"Professional Desk."** You can have your textbook open, your notepad next to it, and a calculator floating on top—all at once. You can resize them and move them around just like you do on a laptop, making homework much faster.
