## Term Definition

**Accessibility Features** are built-in tools across the Apple ecosystem (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, visionOS) designed to assist users with various physical or cognitive needs.

Key tools include:

* **Vision** : VoiceOver (screen reading), Zoom, and Magnifier.
* **Hearing** : Live Captions, Made for iPhone hearing aid support.
* **Motor** : Voice Control, Switch Control, and AssistiveTouch.
* **Cognitive** : Assisted Access and Background Sounds.

MDM allows administrators to **pre-configure** or lock these settings, ensuring that students with special needs have the correct tools ready as soon as they receive their device.

## Analogy

Think of these as the **"Universal Accessibility Ramps"** of the digital world.

Just as public buildings must have ramps and braille signs, Apple builds these tools directly into every device so that everyone, regardless of their physical needs, can learn and explore.

Schools can turn these on automatically for students who need them, saving time for both the student and the teacher.
