## Term Definition

The **Status Channel** is a real-time communication pipeline used in **Declarative Device Management (DDM)** .

Key shift from legacy MDM:

- **Legacy (Polling)** : The server has to proactively ask the device, "Do you have this app installed?" repeatedly.

- **Modern (Status)** : The device automatically subscribes to "status items" (like Battery Health or Passcode Compliance). When a value changes, the device **immediately** notifies the server.
- **Efficiency** : Reduces network traffic and server load while increasing data accuracy.

## Analogy

Think of this as **"The Emergency Radio."** In the old days, a boss had to call every employee every hour to ask, "Is the project done yet?" (this is called polling). It was annoying.

With the **Status Channel** , the employee just radios the boss the moment they finish a task: **"I'm done!"** It’s faster, uses less energy, and keeps the boss informed instantly without constant phone calls.
