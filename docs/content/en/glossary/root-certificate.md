## Term Definition

A ** Root Certificate ** is the fundamental anchor of trust in a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).

Role in a school:

* ** Trust Anchor ** : It is the "Parent" certificate. If a device trusts the Parent, it automatically trusts all "Children" certificates signed by that Parent.
* ** Internal Security ** : Schools generate their own internal "School Root CA."
* ** Deployment ** : This Root Certificate must be installed on every student iPad. Once installed, the iPad will trust the school's private secure Wi-Fi and internal websites, which otherwise would be rejected as "unsafe."

## Analogy

Think of this as the ** "Trusted Founder" ** of a family.

Trust in digital security works like a family tree. If your device trusts the ** "Grandfather" ** (the Root Certificate), it will automatically trust all of his ** "Children and Grandchildren" ** (the other certificates).

However, if your device doesn't know the Grandfather, it will block the entire family from entering—which means you won't be allowed to connect to the secure school Wi-Fi.
