**The primary differences lie in administrative permissions, feature rollout speed, and 'Global Toggle' control. While assets can be moved between them, the daily management experience varies significantly.**

## Three Levels of Administrative Access

In the **MOE Managed Jamf Pro** architecture, permissions are layered to balance security with local flexibility:

1. **MOE Administrators (Full Admin)**: Hold the highest authority over the Jamf Pro instance. They set global security policies and decide when to enable major new DDM (Declarative Device Management) features.
2. **Vendor/Reseller Accounts**: Have broad access to assist multiple schools with deployment but cannot override core MOE-defined restrictions.
3. **School IT Coordinators (Site Admin)**: Have daily operational control over their specific "Site" (e.g., app distribution, smart groups, device naming). However, there are safety restrictions, such as the **inability to delete configuration profiles**. This is a protective measure to ensure critical MOE security settings aren't accidentally removed.

## Core Comparison Matrix

| Item                       | **MOE Managed Instance**                        | **Private/In-House Instance**                    |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| **Highest Authority**      | **Ministry Central IT Team**                    | **School IT Team (100% Control)**                |
| **Server Hosting**         | Jamf Cloud (MOE Tenant)                         | Dedicated Jamf Cloud Instance                    |
| **Profile Management**     | **Protected**. Cannot delete core MOE profiles. | **Unrestricted**. Full control to create/delete. |
| **Software Updates (DDM)** | Managed by Central Admin schedule.              | Fully customizable by the School.                |
| **Automation & API**       | Restricted. Limited custom scripts/API tokens.  | **Fully Open**. Full API and Custom Scripting.   |
| **New Feature Testing**    | Must wait for Central IT to enable.             | Enable on day one of an Apple release.           |

## Important Repository Statement (Disclaimer)

- **Feature Availability**: All management technologies described in this site (e.g., DDM Self-Healing, AI Controls, PSSO) are standard Apple features.
- **'Hidden' Features**: If you cannot find a specific button or setting in your MOE Jamf Pro console, **it does not mean the technology is faulty or your devices are faulty**. It usually means the feature's "Global Toggle" (available only to Full Admins) has not yet been activated by the Ministry's central team.
- **Management Advice**: In the MOE Managed environment, focus on **instructional stability**. If you require a high-degree of experimentation or custom automation, we recommend using a "School-Purchased" private instance for those specific project devices.

## Summary

The MOE version provides a secure, "batteries-included" environment that protects the school from major configuration errors. The In-House version provides the "Absolute Freedom" required for advanced IT departments and custom coding projects.
