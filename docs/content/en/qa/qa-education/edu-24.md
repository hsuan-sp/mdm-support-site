**The 'Writing Tools' in Apple Intelligence can rewrite, proofread, and summarize text even while offline. This poses a significant risk for language and composition exams. On AI-capable devices, these features must be managed via MDM during assessments.**

## Potential for Misuse:

- **Rewrite** : A student enters fragmented notes, and the AI expands them into a polished, professional paragraph.
- **Proofread** : Automatically corrects grammar and syntax errors, making it impossible to grade a student's actual writing proficiency.
- **Summarize** : In a reading comprehension test, the AI can instantly identify the main points of a long text, bypassing the student's need to read.

## Management Solutions:

**Strategy A: The Exam Configuration Profile** Create a Jamf Pro profile specifically for the exam period:

- **Restrictions** : Disable **'Allow Writing Tools'** .
- **Optional** : Also disable **'Allow Math Notes'** to prevent cheating in mathematics exams.
- **Deployment** : Push this profile 15 minutes before the exam and remove it immediately after. **Strategy B: App Lock (Single App Mode)** Using the **Classroom** app's **'App Lock'** feature is the most secure method:

- When locked into a single app, the system-wide text selection menu is suppressed, and the student cannot access the Writing Tools interface. This is effective for both school-owned and BYOD devices.

## Device Capability Audit:

Remember that not all iPads have these features. Use Smart Groups to target only those that require the restriction:

- **Need Restrictions** : iPad Air (M1/M2+), iPad Pro (M1/M4+), iPad mini 7 (A17 Pro).
- **No Action Needed** : iPad 9, iPad 10 (These models lack the Neural Engine required for local Writing Tools).
