**Shared iPad allows multiple students to log into the same physical device using their individual Managed Apple Accounts. Their documents and app data are isolated and synced to iCloud.** This is the ideal solution for computer labs or "trolley systems" where iPads are moved between different year groups throughout the day.

## Comparison Table:

| Feature                  | Standard iPad (1-to-1)    | Shared iPad (Trolley/Lab)             |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------ |
| **User Ownership**       | Assigned to one student   | Rotates between students              |
| **Data Storage**         | Stored locally on device  | **Synced to the Cloud**               |
| **Apple Account**        | Optional                  | **Mandatory (Managed Apple Account)** |
| **Login Speed**          | Instant (FaceID/Passcode) | Slower (Requires User Download)       |
| **Hardware Requirement** | Any modern iPad           | **128GB+ Storage Recommended**        |

## Modern Features for 2026:

- **Proximity Login**: Students can now tap their iPhone or Apple Watch near a Shared iPad to instantly select their profile and authenticate, saving time at the start of a lesson.
- **Return to Service (RTS) Optimization**: On **iOS 26**, the system performs an "Instant Flush" of the previous user's local cache when they log out, ensuring the next student has immediate access to maximum storage capacity.
- **Guest Access**: You can enable a "Guest Mode" where data is completely deleted the moment the student logs out. This is perfect for visiting students or parent demonstration days.

## Institutional Advice:

Because Shared iPad requires downloading user data from the cloud, it places a high demand on your school’s internet bandwidth. We strongly recommend implementing a **Content Caching** server to speed up the login process for large classes.
