**No. Lost Mode is designed specifically for asset recovery. Location services are only activated while the device is officially marked as 'Lost' by an administrator.**

## How it Works:

1. **Enforcement**: Even if a user has disabled Location Services, the MDM forcibly enables them upon receiving the "Lost Mode" command.
2. **Notification**: The device screen locks and displays a custom message (e.g., "This iPad is lost. Please contact the ICT Support Team at...") and a phone number.
3. **Privacy Guard**: Administrators can only receive coordinates while Lost Mode is active. Once Lost Mode is disabled, the device returns to the user’s previous privacy settings, and the administrator can no longer track the device.
