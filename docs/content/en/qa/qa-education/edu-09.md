**You can use a wired HDMI adapter (most stable) or third-party wireless projection software. For the best experience, we recommend the school acquire an Apple TV.**

## Option 1: HDMI Adapters (Highly Recommended)

**Required Equipment**:

- **Lightning Models**: Lightning Digital AV Adapter (Original Apple or MFi certified).

- **USB-C Models**: USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter.
- **HDMI Cable**.

**Steps**:

1. Plug the adapter into the iPad.

2. Connect one end of the HDMI cable to the adapter and the other to the TV/Projector.
3. Switch the TV input to the correct HDMI source.
4. The iPad screen will automatically mirror.

**Pros**:

- Near-zero latency, great for live demos.

- No network required.
- Compatible with any TV/Projector with an HDMI port.

**Cons**:

- Requires carrying an adapter and cable.

- The iPad is tethered to the cable length.
