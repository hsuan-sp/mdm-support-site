## Q: I received an iOS update notification. Can I update immediately or should I wait?

## Answer

** It is recommended to wait for a school announcement before updating. New iOS versions can sometimes cause compatibility issues with teaching apps or MDM functions. The school will coordinate a mass update after verification. ** While Apple releases updates every few weeks for security and features, "newest" isn't always "best" for an educational environment.

## Why Immediate Updates are Discouraged:

| Potential Risk | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| ** App Compatibility ** | Third-party teaching apps may not be optimized for the new version, leading to crashes. |
| ** MDM Instability ** | In rare cases, new versions may have temporary issues with certain Jamf Pro commands. |
| ** Unexpected Bugs ** | New versions may have bugs that Apple hasn't discovered yet; fixes often come weeks later. |
| ** Update Failures ** | Interruptions (low battery, network loss) during update can leave the device in Recovery Mode. |

## The "N-1" Principle:

Many IT teams follow the "N-1" principle: keeping production environments (student/teacher devices) on the previous stable version (N-1) rather than the absolute latest (N). Updates are only pushed when:

* The new version is fully tested.
* Critical app developers confirm compatibility.
* Security patches are deemed essential.

## School Update Strategies:

1. ** Update Deferral ** : MDM can set "Skip software updates for X days," so devices don't see the notification immediately.

1. ** Pilot Groups ** : Updates are pushed to IT or volunteer devices first for a week of validation.

1. ** Scheduled Updates ** : Updates are pushed via MDM during non-teaching hours (nights or weekends).

1. ** Version Blocking ** : If a specific version has a known bug, it can be temporarily blocked.

## Practical Advice:

* ** Don't click "Install Now" ** . Choose "Later" or "Tonight" (and then disable auto-install in Settings).
* ** Wait for School Announcement ** . IT will usually release a "Clear to Update" notice.
* ** Ensure power is >50% and Wi-Fi is stable before updating. **
