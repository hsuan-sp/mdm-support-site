## Q: Boosting classroom productivity with iPadOS 26.2 'Windowed Apps' multitasking.

## Answer

*  **iPadOS 26.2 matures the 'Windowed Apps' system, allowing the iPad to behave more like a traditional computer. For students and teachers who need to cross-reference materials, this is a significant productivity boost.**## Core Operations for Education:

1. **Enabling the Mode**:***Go to**Settings > Multitasking & Gestures**and select**Windowed Apps**. (Note: This is most effective on iPads with M1/M2/M4 chips and secondary displays).

1. **Advanced Window Management**:***Resizable Windows**: Drag any corner to resize an app.***Overlapping**: Move a research browser (Safari) over a writing tool (Pages).***Slide Over (v26.2 Enhanced)**: Use the window control button to send a dictionary or calculator to "Slide Over." These windows now stay pinned on top and can be swiped away and back instantly from the screen edge.

1. **The Menu Bar**:***Swipe down from the very top to reveal the**Menu Bar**, giving students quick access to app commands without digging through menus, much like a Mac.

## Best Practices for Students:***The Split-Research Layout**: Open a teaching video on the left and a note-taking app on the right.***The Slide Over Dictionary**: Keep a dictionary or translation app in Slide Over so it can be summoned instantly over a reading assignment and dismissed just as fast.

## Teacher Insight:

While powerful, Windowed Apps can be overwhelming for younger students (K-3). We recommend only enabling this mode for secondary school students or as a reward for students who have demonstrated high digital literacy and focus.
