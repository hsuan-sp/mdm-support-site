## Q: MOE Cybersecurity Audit: How does MDM help comply with NIST standards?

## Answer

** Educational devices must comply with NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) 800-63 guidelines to ensure identity security and data privacy. ** ## NIST Standards in MDM:

1. ** Authenticator Assurance (Passcodes) ** :

* ** 2026 Standard ** : Move away from simple periodic password changes toward "anti-guessing" and MFA.
* ** MDM Practice ** : Force 6-digit minimum passcodes and enable Managed Apple Account MFA.

1. ** Managed App Attestation ** :

* Utilize ** iOS 26 ** hardware-backed attestation to ensure apps are installed via authorized MDM channels and haven't been compromised by Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.

1. ** Vulnerability management ** :

* Use ** DDM (Declarative Device Management) ** to set strict update deadlines. Ensure all fleet devices are patched within 48 hours of a critical security release.

## Pro-Tip for IT Managers: Use a Lab Environment

Since the "MOE Centralized Jamf Pro" must manage millions of devices, some cutting-edge DDM features may have a rollout delay.

* ** Advice ** : If your school has an independent ** Jamf School/Pro ** instance, use it as a ** "Beta Test Lab." *** Test your iOS 26 profiles and DDM status channels there first. When the central MOE instance is updated, you will already be an expert on the configuration, ensuring your school passes cybersecurity audits with flying colors.
