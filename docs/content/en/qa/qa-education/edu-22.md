## Q: The AirDrop Code Mechanism: Practical impact on classroom file sharing and how to adapt.

## Answer

**In iOS 26.2, iPadOS 26.2, and macOS 26.2, the 'AirDrop Code' mechanism means that first-time transfers between people not in each other's contacts require a 6-digit code. This changes the 'Everyone open AirDrop' workflow but can be managed effectively.** ## The New Workflow:

1. **Sender** : Selects the file and clicks the student's name in AirDrop.

1. **Recipient** : Taps "Get AirDrop Code" (since they aren't in the teacher's contacts).

1. **Sender** : Enters the 6-digit code shown on the student's screen.

1. **Trust established** : For the next 30 days, these two devices can swap files without a code.

## School Challenges:

* Because school iPads often have iCloud Sync blocked or use Shared accounts, students almost never appear in each other's "Contacts."
* This makes the old way of "Everyone turn on AirDrop and I'll send the PDF" more time-consuming for the first session of the term.

## Strategies for the Classroom:

1. **Prioritize the 'Classroom' App (Recommended)** :

* The **Classroom** app bypasses the AirDrop Code requirement entirely.
* **Action** : Teachers should use the "Navigate" or "Share" function within the Classroom app to push PDFs and URLs. It's faster, requires no student confirmation, and works for the whole class simultaneously.

1. **'Pairing Day' Routine** :

* If your curriculum requires formats that Classroom doesn't support (like large Keynote project files), dedicate 5 minutes at the start of the semester for "Pairing Day."
* Have students pair with their neighbors using the AirDrop code once. This trust will last for 30 days.

1. **Cloud Relay** :

* Upload the material to Google Drive or a school NAS and push the*link* via Classroom. Students can then download at their own pace without worrying about peer-to-peer pairing.

## Advice for Teachers:

Inform your staff that the AirDrop Code is a **Security Feature** to prevent "Airdropping" of inappropriate images from strangers. While it adds a small step to the first interaction, it creates a much safer digital environment for the students.
