## Q: Why is my iPad suddenly requiring a 6-digit (or longer) passcode?

## Answer

**This is because an administrator has deployed a 'Passcode Configuration' profile to meet school security standards.** ## Common Requirements:

1. **Minimum Length** : Increased from the default 4 digits to 6 or more.

1. **Complexity** : May require letters or forbid simple sequences (like "123456").

1. **Grace Period** : Once the profile is pushed, you typically have 60 minutes to update your passcode. If ignored, the device will force a pop-up prompt until the requirement is met.

## Practical Advice:

Choose a passcode that is easy to remember but hard for others to guess. If you forget your passcode, you must contact the ICT Support Team to have the device cleared via MDM.
