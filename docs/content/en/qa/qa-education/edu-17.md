## Q: Why is the 'Screen Recording' button missing or grayed out on student iPads?

## Answer

** This is typically because 'Screen Recording' is restricted in the school's MDM profile, or the button simply hasn't been added to the Control Center. ** ## Troubleshooting Steps:

1. ** Check MDM Restrictions (Most Common) ** :

* Many schools disable ** Allow screen recording ** in the ** Restrictions ** profile to prevent students from recording lessons or non-educational content.
* ** Fix ** : If a teacher requires this for a project, the IT Coordinator must enable it in Jamf Pro for that specific classroom group.

1. ** Check Control Center Settings ** :

* If not restricted but still missing, the button might not be in the menu.
* ** Fix ** : Go to ** Settings > Control Center ** and tap the green ** + ** next to ** Screen Recording ** .

1. ** Check Screen Time ** :

* If a student (or parent) enabled local Screen Time restrictions, this can also block the feature. Check ** Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions ** .
