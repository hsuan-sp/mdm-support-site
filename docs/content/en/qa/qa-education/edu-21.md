## Q: How do I manage the new 'Notification Summary' AI feature in iOS 18?

## Answer

**iOS 18 introduces AI-powered notification summaries. While useful for filtering noise, it may cause students to miss critical full-context messages during class.** ## Management Strategies:

* **MDM Restriction** : Administrators can use the Restrictions payload to disable **'Allow Intelligent Notification Preview'** . This prevents the AI from summarizing notifications.
* **Classroom Tip** : Instead of a full block, encourage students to configure this within a "Classroom Focus" mode. This allows the AI to only show urgent educational alerts while summarizing distracting social notifications until the end of the school day.
