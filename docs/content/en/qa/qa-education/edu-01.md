## Q: The VPN icon is missing on iPadOS. Are network filtering and usage reporting still working?

## Answer

*  **Yes, everything is working perfectly. In modern iPadOS versions (17 through 26), Jamf Trust uses "DNS Proxy" and "Content Filter" technology which does not require a VPN tunnel.**This architectural shift is intentional and was implemented to improve device battery life and network stability across school campuses.

## Why the Icon is Gone:***Legacy (iOS 16 & older)**: Used "Always-On VPN" which displayed a permanent VPN icon.***Modern (iOS 17 - 26)**: Uses native**Content Filtering APIs**. These operate at the system level without needing a separate VPN connection, so the icon is no longer displayed in the status bar.

## How to Verify Protection is Active:

1. **Open the Jamf Trust App**: If it shows a**Green Shield (Protected)**, your data is being recorded and filtered correctly.
2. **Test the Filter**: Try navigating to a known blocked category (e.g., a gaming site) in Safari. If the page is blocked, the filter is active.
3. **Check Jamf Pro**: Reconfirm that the "DNS Proxy" and "Content Filter" profiles are marked as "Installed" in the device inventory.

## New for 2026: Return to Service (Return to Service) Protection

In macOS and**iOS 26**, these network filters are now protected by**Return to Service (Return to Service)**. Even if a device is erased, the management configuration is baked into the reactivation process, ensuring the device is "Born Protected" the moment it joins a network.

## Institutional Advice:

Occasionally, the Jamf Trust app might show a red warning if a passcode is missing or the OS is out of date. While you should encourage students to update,**these local warnings do not stop the usage statistics from being reported to the school dashboard.**
