## Q: Can iPads from the Digital Learning Project (MOE) still be used after the project expires? Is upgrading to iPadOS 26 safe?

## Answer

*  **iPads provided by the Digital Learning Project are school assets. Even after the initial project period concludes, they can continue to be used as long as the school maintains them. Upgrading to iPadOS 26 is technically viable and highly recommended, provided you consider MDM server compatibility.**## Evaluation for the iPadOS 26 Upgrade

## 1. Hardware Longevity***The primary project device is the**iPad (9th Gen, A13 chip)**.***Follow-on purchases may include the**iPad (10th Gen, A14 chip)**or the**iPad (11th Gen, A16 chip)**.***All three models fully support iPadOS 26**.***Note**: While these models cannot run "Apple Intelligence" features due to hardware limitations, they still benefit from critical security updates and performance optimizations (like the improved Return to Service).

## 2. MDM Compatibility***Centralized Instance**: If your devices are managed by the Ministry’s central**Jamf Pro**, verify that the central server has been updated to a version that supports iPadOS 26.***Self-Managed**: If your school manages its own server (Mosyle, Intune, or a private Jamf instance), verify compatibility before a mass rollout.***Pilot Test**: Always upgrade one test unit to iPadOS 26 first. Verify that app distribution, restriction profiles, and Wi-Fi certificates function as expected before upgrading the whole fleet.

## 3. Benefits of Upgrading***Security**: Access to iOS 26 "Background Security Improvements" and the latest patches.***Stability**: Fixes for known Wi-Fi connectivity issues present in earlier versions (like iOS 18).***Support Cycle**: Ensures the 2022–2023 fleet remains supported by modern educational apps through at least 2027.

## Recommendations for Post-Project Use

We recommend maintaining your existing management framework to protect the learning environment:***Ownership**: The device remains school property; management settings should remain identical to when it was in use during the project.***App Guidelines**: If the App Store is currently blocked, keep it blocked to prevent the device from becoming a gaming console at home.***Safety**: Continue using your Content Filter (e.g., Jamf Safe Internet) to protect students from inappropriate content while using the device off-campus.

## Summary Advice

As long as the hardware is healthy and your MDM server is up to date, upgrading to iPadOS 26 is the safest and most efficient way to extend the lifespan and educational value of your project investment.
