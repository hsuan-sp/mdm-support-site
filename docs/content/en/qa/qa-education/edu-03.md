## Q: What are the configuration differences between Teacher iPads and Student iPads?

## Answer

**Teacher and Student devices are usually assigned different management profiles, app catalogs, and restriction levels to provide teachers with the flexibility needed for classroom instruction.** In Jamf Pro, we use Smart Groups to separate these roles and ensure that the right rules are applied to the right person.

## Key Policy Differences:

| Setting | Teacher iPad | Student iPad |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Apple Intelligence** | **Full Access** (Rewrite/Summarize) | **Restricted** (Summarize Only) |
| **AirDrop** | Unrestricted | Restricted or "Teacher-Only" |
| **App Installations** | Allowed via Self Service Pro | Managed strictly by IT |
| **Content Filtering** | Relaxed (Standard Web) | Strict (Child Safety Enforced) |
| **Apple Classroom** | **Teacher Role** (Controller) | **Student Role** (Managed) |
| **Jamf Teacher App** | Create Lessons / Clear Passcodes | Receive Lessons |
| **Zero-Wipe Migration** | Available for data transfer | Restricted to IT staff |

## Implementation in Jamf Pro:

* **Automatic Naming** : We recommend using a prefix like `T-` (Teacher) and `S-` (Student) during enrollment.
* **Scoped Profiles** : Create a "Student Restrictions" profile and scope it*exclusively* to the Student Smart Group. Create a separate, "Lighter Restrictions" profile for staff.
* **App Deployment** : Some specialized creative or assessment apps (like Goodnotes or Exam.net) might be deployed to all devices, while administrative tools (like ManageBac or PowerSchool Teacher) are scoped only to staff.

## Institutional Advice:

Periodically audit your Smart Groups. When a staff member leaves or replaces their hardware, ensure their new device is correctly tagged as a "Teacher" asset to avoid giving students unrestricted access to staff-level tools.
