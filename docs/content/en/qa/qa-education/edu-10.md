## Q: Why is the App Store missing? How do I download apps?

## Answer

**This is an intentional setting by the school. The App Store is hidden to prevent students from downloading unauthorized apps. Use the 'Self Service' app to install school-approved applications instead.** Finding the App Store missing is a result of MDM restrictions, not a malfunction.

## Why the App Store is Hidden:

| Reason | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prevent Gaming** | Keeps students focused on learning tools. |
| **Consistency** | Ensures all devices have the same approved apps for teaching. |
| **Account Safety** | Prevents data mixing or Activation Lock from personal Apple Accounts. |
| **License Compliance** | Ensures all apps are legally licensed via VPP. |

## How to Install Apps: Using Self Service

**Self Service** is Jamf's "School App Store." Administrators choose which apps are available for students and staff. **Steps** :

1. Find the **Self Service** app on the Home Screen (usually the school logo or Jamf icon).
1. Open the app and browse available resources.
1. Find the app you need and tap **Install** .
1. The app installs automatically **without needing an Apple Account password** .
1. Wait for the app to appear on the Home Screen.

## Benefits of Self Service:

* **No Password Required** : Uses silent VPP licensing.
* **Vetted Apps** : Only school-approved apps appear.
* **Instant Updates** : Admins can push new apps or updates remotely.

## If an App is missing from Self Service:

1. **Submit a request via the School Support Portal or to your Instructor** : Explain why it's needed for class.

1. **Institutional Purchase** : The school buys licenses via ASM/VPP.

1. **Deployment** : Once approved, the admin adds it to Self Service for everyone.

## Troubleshooting:

* **Self Service won't open** : Check your internet connection and try restarting the iPad.
* **Install button is grey** : Licensing may be low or a background process is active; try again later.
* **Can't find Self Service** : Check inside folders or the second page. You can also use Spotlight to search for it.
