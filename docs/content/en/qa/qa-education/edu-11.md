## Q: What is the difference between 'Guided Access' and 'Single App Mode'?

## Answer

** Both features lock the iPad into a single application, but they offer different levels of control: Guided Access is manually enabled by a user (e.g., a teacher), while Single App Mode is enforced remotely via MDM. ** These two methods are often confused, but they serve different purposes:

## Feature Comparison:

| Feature | ** Guided Access ** | ** Single App Mode (ASAM) ** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ** Activation ** | Manual (Triple-click Power/Home button) | Remote MDM command or App-triggered |
| ** Primary Use ** | Classroom focus, early childhood | ** High-stakes Testing (CBT) ** , Kiosks |
| ** Student Exit ** | Possible (if PIN is known) | ** Impossible to exit manually ** |
| ** AI Feature Control ** | Requires manual Accessibility adjustment | ** Automatically disables system AI ** (e.g., Writing Tools) |
| ** After Reboot ** | Disables (must be restarted) | ** Remains Locked ** |
| ** MDM Required ** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

## Practical Advice:

* ** Use Guided Access ** for quick, low-stakes classroom management where a teacher needs students to stay in one app for a short duration.
* ** Use Single App Mode ** for formal exams or public-facing informational kiosks where manual tampering must be completely prevented.
