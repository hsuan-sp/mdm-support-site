## Q: Can paid app licenses be shared between different schools? (Cross-school VPP)

## Answer

*  **Yes. This is achieved through 'Location' management within Apple School Manager (ASM).**This is highly effective for centralized procurement by a school district or a main campus.

## How it Works:

1. **Centralized Purchase**: A Super Admin purchases 10,000 licenses at a "Main Office" location in ASM.
2. **Internal Transfer**: Use the**Transfer Licenses**feature to move, for example, 1,000 licenses to "Elementary School A" and 500 to "Junior High B."
3. **Independent Management**: The administrators at each school log in to their local MDM and see only the licenses allocated to their specific location.

## Benefits:

Allows for "Bulk Procurement / Negotiated Pricing" while maintaining "Independent School Management," greatly simplifying the accounting process.
