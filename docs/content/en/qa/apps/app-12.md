## Q: Can paid app licenses be shared between different schools? (Cross-school VPP)

## Answer

**Yes. This is achieved through 'Location' management within Apple School Manager (ASM).** This is highly effective for centralized procurement by a school district or a main campus.

## How it Works:

1. **Centralized Purchase** : A Super Admin purchases 10,000 licenses at a "Main Office" location in ASM.

1. **Internal Transfer** : Use the **Transfer Licenses** feature to move, for example, 1,000 licenses to "Elementary School A" and 500 to "Junior High B."

1. **Independent Management** : The administrators at each school log in to their local MDM and see only the licenses allocated to their specific location.

## Benefits:

Allows for "Bulk Procurement / Negotiated Pricing" while maintaining "Independent School Management," greatly simplifying the accounting process.
