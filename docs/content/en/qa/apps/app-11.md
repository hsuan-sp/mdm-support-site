## Q: How do I distribute E-books (PDF/ePub) to student iPads?

## Answer

*  **Apple School Manager (ASM) in many regions (including Taiwan) does not support the direct purchase or distribution of content from the Apple Books Store.**However, you can still distribute your own PDFs or ePub files to students using several methods:

## Option 1: Distribution via MDM

1. **Upload to Jamf Pro**: In the "eBooks" section of Jamf Pro, you can directly upload PDF or ePub files.
2. **Assign to Devices**: Scope these custom e-books to your target device groups.
3. **Student Access**: Students will find these materials ready for reading in the native**Books**app on their iPads.

## Option 2: Using the 'Files' App or Cloud Storage

1. **Cloud Hosting**: Upload materials to a school cloud service (e.g., Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive).
2. **Deploy the Cloud App**: Distribute the corresponding app via Jamf Pro.
3. **Student Access**: Students open the app to view and download the teaching materials.

## Option 3: Learning Management Systems (LMS)***Upload materials to your LMS (e.g., Google Classroom, Canvas). Students access the content via the LMS app or web browser.**## Key Considerations:***Regional Restrictions**: You cannot "purchase" books from the Apple Books Store in bulk through ASM like you do with apps in certain regions.***Copyright**: Ensure you have the legal right to distribute any materials you upload to these platforms.

## Practical Advice:

Focus on distributing custom PDF/ePub files or leveraging existing cloud and LMS platforms rather than trying to deploy content directly from the Apple Books Store through ASM.
