**Apple School Manager (ASM) in many regions (including Taiwan) does not support the direct purchase or distribution of content from the Apple Books Store.** However, you can still distribute your own PDFs or ePub files to students using several methods:

## Option 1: Distribution via MDM

1. **Upload to Jamf Pro** : In the "eBooks" section of Jamf Pro, you can directly upload PDF or ePub files.

1. **Assign to Devices** : Scope these custom e-books to your target device groups.

1. **Student Access** : Students will find these materials ready for reading in the native **Books** app on their iPads.

## Option 2: Using the 'Files' App or Cloud Storage

1. **Cloud Hosting** : Upload materials to a school cloud service (e.g., Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive).

1. **Deploy the Cloud App** : Distribute the corresponding app via Jamf Pro.

1. **Student Access** : Students open the app to view and download the teaching materials.

## Option 3: Learning Management Systems (LMS)

- Upload materials to your LMS (e.g., Google Classroom, Canvas). Students access the content via the LMS app or web browser.

## Key Considerations:

- **Regional Restrictions** : You cannot "purchase" books from the Apple Books Store in bulk through ASM like you do with apps in certain regions.
- **Copyright** : Ensure you have the legal right to distribute any materials you upload to these platforms.

## Practical Advice:

Focus on distributing custom PDF/ePub files or leveraging existing cloud and LMS platforms rather than trying to deploy content directly from the Apple Books Store through ASM.
