## Q: How do I manage the AI-assisted teaching apps in 2024–2025 (e.g., Writing Tools, Image Playground)?

## Answer

**With Apple Intelligence reaching full maturity in 2024–2025, teaching apps have entered the "AI-Assisted Era."****For schools, the primary challenge is balancing the productivity gains of AI with academic integrity, data privacy, and security.****iOS 26/iPadOS 26 provides granular MDM controls to manage these features.** ## 1. Controlling Core AI Features

Administrators can manage these via a "Restrictions" profile in Jamf Pro:

* **Writing Tools** : Can be set to "Allow All," "On-Device Processing Only," or "Disabled." During formal exams, it is recommended to disable this via a DDM declaration to ensure students write independently.
* **Image Generation (Image Playground / Genmoji)** : Access can be restricted to specific grade levels or limited to certain apps (e.g., Freeform).

## 2. Auditing Third-Party AI Apps

For apps integrating third-party LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini):

* **Review Privacy Labels** : App Store requirements in 2026 demand transparent AI privacy labels. Admins should prioritize apps labeled as "Not tracking personal data" or "Contextual reasoning only."
* **VPP Distribution** : Distribute approved AI tools via Jamf Pro and restrict students from downloading unvetted AI apps from the App Store.

## 3. Flexible Management in the Classroom

* **Using Jamf Teacher/Classroom** : Teachers can use "App Lock" to keep students within a specific app, which automatically suppresses system-wide AI Writing Tools.
* **Network-Level Filtering** : Install a "Content Filtering" profile via MDM to precisely control access to AI model servers if there are concerns about over-reliance on browser-based AI tools. **💡 Strategy Tip** :

Instead of a total ban, consider allowing AI tools for "Creative projects" while using Jamf Pro to push "Assessment Mode (ASAM)" to automatically disable all AI assistants during exams.
