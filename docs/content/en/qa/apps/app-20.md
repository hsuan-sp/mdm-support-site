**Declarative Device Management (DDM) is a major evolution of the Apple MDM protocol, allowing devices to autonomously maintain their state based on 'Declarations' from the server.**

## Core Differences from Traditional MDM:

1. **Desired State Management**:
   - **Old Way**: Server sends an "Install App" command. If a user deletes the app later, the server must wait to scan the device again and re-send the command.
   - **New Way (DDM)**: Server declares "This app MUST exist." The device **continuously monitors itself**. If it detects the app is missing, it triggers a redownload automatically without waiting for a server command.

2. **Status Channel**:
   - The device **proactively** reports detailed app installation progress (e.g., waiting, installing, verification failed) to Jamf Pro via a lightweight status channel. This is much faster and uses less bandwidth than traditional "Server Polling."

3. **Predicates (Local Logic)**:
   - Administrators can set installation conditions (e.g., "Only install if OS version > 17"). The device performs this logic evaluation locally, removing the need for the server to perform heavy calculations for every device.
