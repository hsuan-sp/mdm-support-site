## Q: What details should we keep in mind when 'purchasing' free apps in bulk?

## Answer

*  **In the Apple ecosystem, even $0 free apps must go through the "Purchase" workflow in Apple School Manager (ASM) to be authorized for school distribution.**## Key Details to Consider:

1. **Location Token (VPP Token) Match**:

*  If your school has multiple "Locations" in ASM (e.g., "Primary Campus" vs. "Secondary Campus"), you must purchase the apps for the*exact same* location that is linked to your Jamf Pro server. Licenses bought for Location A cannot be used by a server linked to Location B.

2. **Sync Lag**:***After hitting "Get" in ASM, the licenses don't appear in Jamf Pro instantly. There is usually a**2-10 minute synchronization delay**between Apple’s servers and your MDM dashboard.

1. **Purchase Quantity**:***Since the licenses are free, we recommend "purchasing" a quantity that far exceeds your current needs (e.g., if you have 500 iPads, buy 2,000 licenses). This prevents deployment failures if you add more devices later.**## Troubleshooting Tip:

If an app is showing a "0 available" count in Jamf Pro despite being purchased in ASM, check the Location settings first and then manually trigger a**"Sync VPP Content"**in the Jamf Global Management settings.
