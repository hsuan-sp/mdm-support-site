## Q: Do I need the student's Apple ID password to update apps? How can I achieve silent updates?

## Answer

** No password is required. As long as you use "Device-based Assignment," the update process is completely hands-off. ** ## The Preferred 2026 Method: Declarative Device Management (DDM)

Under the latest OS architecture, ** DDM ** is the best path for silent updates:

* ** Autonomy ** : The device itself monitors app versions based on the MDM declaration and triggers downloads in the background. It no longer relies on a one-way "push" command from the server.
* ** Status Transparency ** : Admins get real-time progress reports (e.g., "Downloading" or "Insufficient Space") instead of the vague "Pending" status seen in older MDM versions.

## Traditional MDM Configuration (Compatibility Layer):

1. ** License Mode ** : Must be set to "Device-based" (bound to serial number).

1. ** Supervised Mode ** : The iPad must be in a "Supervised" state.

1. ** Jamf Configuration ** : In the app's distribution settings, enable ** "Automatically Update App." **** Note: On DDM-supported devices, this checkbox automatically triggers a DDM declaration.*

## Common Troubleshooting for Failed Updates:

* ** App in Use ** : If a student is currently using the app, the system will typically wait until the app is in the background or the device is idle before updating.
* ** Insufficient Storage ** : Updates require temporary space to download the installer. If the device is full, the update will fail.
* ** Stuck Commands ** : If you see many pending update commands, try sending a ** "Blank Push" ** to force the device to check in with Apple servers. ** Note ** : DDM makes the device more proactive in scheduling updates, reducing its real-time dependency on the MDM server for simple maintenance tasks.
