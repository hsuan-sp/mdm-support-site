**Search results in Apple School Manager (ASM) can sometimes differ from the consumer App Store. If you cannot find a specific item, check these factors in order:**

## 1. Search by Apple ID String (Recommended)

Don't search by name. Instead, find the app on the web-based App Store and locate its unique ID (e.g., `id123456789`). Paste this ID directly into the ASM search bar. This is the most accurate way to find a specific entry.

## 2. Regional Store Consistency

ASM only searches the App Store associated with your organization's registered region (e.g., the Taiwan store). If a developer has released an app exclusively for the U.S. store, it will not appear in a Taiwan-based ASM account.

## 3. B2B / Custom Apps

Some proprietary or school-specific apps are distributed as "Custom Apps." Ensure the developer has added your **Organization ID** to their distribution list in App Store Connect.

## Risk Warning:

If an app has been removed (delisted) from the App Store, you may be unable to download it to new devices even if you have remaining VPP licenses. Administrators should periodically audit the status of critical teaching apps in the store to avoid deployment gaps.
