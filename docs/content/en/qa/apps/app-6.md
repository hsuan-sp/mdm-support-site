## Q: What is the difference between Managed Apps and personally installed apps? Can students take their apps with them after graduation?

## Answer

*  **It depends on the "purchaser" identity and the "management attributes" of the app. App licenses and the data inside them should be considered separately.**In a managed environment, apps are categorized as either "Managed" or "Personal," each with a completely different lifecycle:

## 1. School-assigned "Managed Apps"***Source**: Purchased by administrators via**Apple School Manager (ASM)**and deployed through an MDM using "Device-based assignment."***Ownership**: The license belongs to the**school**.***Graduation/Departure Process**:***License Recovery**: When a student leaves and the device is unenrolled, the MDM revokes the license. The app will either disappear from the device or become inaccessible.***The license is then returned to the school's VPP (Volume Purchase Program) pool for the next student to use.*****Data Risk**: If the "Remove app when management profile is removed" setting is enabled, all data stored within the app (e.g., unsaved projects, local notes) will be**permanently erased**.

## 2. Apps purchased with a student's personal Apple Account***Source**: Purchased by the student on a personal or unrestricted device using their private Apple Account.***Ownership**: The license belongs permanently to the**individual student**.***Graduation/Departure Process**:***Permanent Access**: The student can redownload the app on any new device by signing in with the same Apple Account, unaffected by the school's MDM.***Note**: On internal "Supervised" school iPads, admins often restrict personal Apple Account logins to the App Store, so these apps are less common on school-owned hardware.

## Key Technical Mechanism: Converting Unmanaged to Managed***Conversion Behavior**: If a student has already manually installed an app (e.g., Notability), and the MDM attempts to deploy the same app, administrators can trigger a request to "take over" management of the app.***Impact**: Once converted, the app is subject to school policies, such as being prohibited from backing up to a personal iCloud account.

## Institutional Advice & Risk Management***Data Migration**: Teachers and students should ensure important projects are exported to cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive) or sent via AirDrop before graduation.***Once management is revoked, Managed Apps and any un-synced data within them cannot be recovered.*****BYOD Recommendation**: For student-owned devices, using the "User Enrollment" mode is recommended. This maintains a clear separation between personal and school data, allowing the school to remove its apps without affecting the student's personal photos or purchases.
