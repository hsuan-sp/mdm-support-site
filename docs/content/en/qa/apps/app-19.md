## Q: How do I lock an iPad into a 'Single App' for exams? Can students exit themselves?

## Answer

** Standard 'Single App Mode' cannot be exited by the user. If you need exit flexibility, you should use 'Autonomous Single App Mode (ASAM)'. ** Choosing the wrong mode is a leading cause of "bricked" devices during school deployments:

## Mode 1: MDM-Enforced Single App Mode

* ** Logic ** : The administrator sends a lock command. The device remains locked until a second "unlock" command is received.
* ** Risk ** : ** Network Dependency ** . If Wi-Fi fails while locked, the device cannot receive the unlock command. Since the user cannot access Settings to reconnect Wi-Fi, the device is "stuck" and may require an Ethernet adapter (RJ45) or a full restore to rescue.
* ** Use Case ** : Kiosks, digital signage, library lookup stations.

## Mode 2: Autonomous Single App Mode (ASAM) — Recommended for Exams

* ** Logic ** : Permission is delegated to the app. When a student starts an exam, the ** App locks itself ** . Once the exam is submitted, the ** App unlocks itself ** .
* ** Benefit ** : No network dependency for unlocking. Even if the Wi-Fi drops, the student can finish the exam and the app can release the lock locally.
* ** Setup ** : In Jamf Pro, add the app's Bundle ID to the "Autonomous Single App Mode" allowlist in a Restrictions profile.

## Mode 3: Guided Access — Small Scale

* ** Logic ** : A local iOS feature (not MDM). A teacher triples-clicks the power button to lock.
* ** Benefit ** : Controlled by the person in the room; no "network bricking" risk.

## Practical Advice for 2026:

* ** Formal Assessments ** : Require your software vendor to support ** ASAM ** (e.g., LockDown Browser). This is the enterprise standard. ** OS 26 integrates ASAM into the DDM framework, ensuring stability even during transient network drops. ***** Informal Quizzes ** : Use ** Guided Access ** for manual control.
* ** Avoid ** : MDM-Enforced Single App Mode for large groups of student devices unless you have 100% Wi-Fi confidence and Ethernet adapters on standby.
