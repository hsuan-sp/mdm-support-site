## Q: Can I standardize the iPad Home Screen layout for students?

## Answer

**Yes. Using a 'Home Screen Layout' configuration profile, administrators can precisely define the placement of apps on student devices.** ## Configuration Method:

1. In Jamf Pro, go to **Mobile Devices > Configuration Profiles** .
1. Select the **Home Screen Layout** payload.
1. Define the contents of the **Dock** and specific **Pages** .
1. You can create "Folders" to group similar apps (e.g., iWork productivity tools).

## Important Constraints and Risks:

* **Locked Layout** : Once applied, **students cannot move or delete app icons** on the Home Screen. The entire layout is "frozen" in the state defined by the administrator.
* **The Overflow Effect** : Any apps not specified in your layout will be pushed to the final page or hidden in the App Library.
* **Recommendation** : This is ideal for younger students or special education needs where a simplified, consistent interface is required. For older students, we recommend allowing flexibility for them to organize their own learning environments.
* **Note** : Many regional MOE/School District setups already include a default layout. Verify yours before creating a competing profile.
