  How to update apps via Jamf Pro? (Automated Enforcement and Manual Force
  Update)

## Q: How do I update apps via Jamf Pro? Can I force an update manually?

## Answer

*  **In Jamf Pro, app updates are primarily managed through "Automated Enforcement" and the "Force Update" button.**To ensure classroom iPads remain up-to-date, it is recommended to combine automated checking with manual enforcement when necessary.

## 1. Configuring Automated Updates and Sync Schedules

Go to**Devices > Mobile Device Apps**and select the app you wish to manage. In the**"General"**tab, configure the following:***Schedule App Checks**: Check the option**「排程 Jamf Pro，使其自動檢查 App Store 是否有應用程式更新」**(Schedule Jamf Pro to automatically check the App Store for app updates). This ensures Jamf Pro stays informed about new descriptions, icons, and versions.***Automated Enforcement**: Check**「自動強制執行 App 更新」**(Automatically force app updates). The system will then automatically send update commands to mobile devices whenever a new version is detected.***Sync Time**: Adjust the**「App Store Sync Time」**to a time outside of school hours (e.g., midnight) to avoid peak network traffic.

## 2. Manually Forcing App Updates (Force Update)

For urgent updates, navigate to**Devices > Mobile Device Apps**and select the target app. You can trigger an update manually without waiting for the schedule:

1. Go to the detailed information page for the app.
2. Scroll down to the**「強制應用程式更新」**(Force App Update) section.
3. Click the**`Force Update`**button. Jamf Pro will immediately send a force update command to all devices within the app's**"Scope."**## 3. Considerations for 2026: DDM and Update Constraints

In iOS 26 and the latest system environments, update execution is still subject to the following rules:***In-Use Limitation**: If a student is currently using the app, the update will remain "Pending." Forcing the update will attempt to close the app, which may cause a crash during teaching.***Single App Mode**: If an iPad is in "Guided Access" or "Single App Mode," it will not receive or install app updates. The mode must be deactivated first.***Silent Conversion**: If an app was originally installed manually by a student, ensure**「將非管理式 App 轉換為管理式」**(Convert Unmanaged app to managed) is enabled so Jamf Pro can take control.***� � Pro Tip**:

When pushing mass updates, ensure your school's**"Content Caching"**server is working properly to prevent all iPads from downloading from Apple simultaneously and saturating your bandwidth.
