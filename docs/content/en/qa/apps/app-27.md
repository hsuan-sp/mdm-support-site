## Q: How do I update apps via Jamf Pro? Can I force an update manually?

## Answer

**In Jamf Pro, app updates are primarily managed through "Automated Enforcement" and the "Force Update" button.** To ensure classroom iPads remain up-to-date, it is recommended to combine automated checking with manual enforcement when necessary.

## 1. Configuring Automated Updates and Sync Schedules

Go to **Devices > Mobile Device Apps** and select the app you wish to manage. In the **"General"** tab, configure the following:

* **Schedule App Checks** : Check the option **「排程 Jamf Pro，使其自動檢查 App Store 是否有應用程式更新」** (Schedule Jamf Pro to automatically check the App Store for app updates). This ensures Jamf Pro stays informed about new descriptions, icons, and versions.
* **Automated Enforcement** : Check **「自動強制執行 App 更新」** (Automatically force app updates). The system will then automatically send update commands to mobile devices whenever a new version is detected.
* **Sync Time** : Adjust the **「App Store Sync Time」** to a time outside of school hours (e.g., midnight) to avoid peak network traffic.

## 2. Manually Forcing App Updates (Force Update)

For urgent updates, navigate to **Devices > Mobile Device Apps** and select the target app. You can trigger an update manually without waiting for the schedule:

1. Go to the detailed information page for the app.
1. Scroll down to the **「強制應用程式更新」** (Force App Update) section.
1. Click the **`Force Update`** button. Jamf Pro will immediately send a force update command to all devices within the app's **"Scope."** ## 3. Considerations for 2026: DDM and Update Constraints

In iOS 26 and the latest system environments, update execution is still subject to the following rules:

* **In-Use Limitation** : If a student is currently using the app, the update will remain "Pending." Forcing the update will attempt to close the app, which may cause a crash during teaching.
* **Single App Mode** : If an iPad is in "Guided Access" or "Single App Mode," it will not receive or install app updates. The mode must be deactivated first.
* **Silent Conversion** : If an app was originally installed manually by a student, ensure **「將非管理式 App 轉換為管理式」** (Convert unmanaged app to managed) is enabled so Jamf Pro can take control. **💡 Pro Tip** :

When pushing mass updates, ensure your school's **"Content Caching"** server is working properly to prevent all iPads from downloading from Apple simultaneously and saturating your bandwidth.
