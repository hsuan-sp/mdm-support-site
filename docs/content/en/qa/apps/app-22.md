## Q: Purchasing Procreate vs. Procreate Pocket: What's the difference, and what if we bought the wrong version?

## Answer

**Buying the wrong version of a high-profile app is a common clerical error in educational procurement.** These two apps are distinct product lines and do **not** support "Universal Purchase."

## Specification Comparison:

* **Procreate (iPad version)** : Designed specifically for iPadOS and Apple Pencil. Supports large canvases and the full brush engine. This is the industry standard for art classes. **Higher price point** .
* **Procreate Pocket (iPhone version)** : Designed for the smaller iPhone interface. While it*can*be installed on an iPad (via compatibility mode), it will have black bars around the interface and lacks support for Pencil pressure sensitivity and tilt. **Lower price point** .

## Standard Process for Correction:

1. **Request a VPP Refund** :

* The administrator should log in to **Apple School Manager** , go to **Settings > Payments and Billing > View Purchase History** .
* Alternatively, log in to **reportaproblem.apple.com** using the Managed Apple Account used for the purchase.
* Select the order and "Request a refund," citing "Purchased wrong version." ** Note: Apple typically decides on refunds within 24–48 hours.*

1. **Re-purchase** :

* Because the licenses are not interchangeable, you must purchase the correct iPad version to deploy it to student iPads.

1. **Clean Up** :

* In Jamf Pro, ensure you remove the "Pocket" version from any scopes to prevent students from installing the low-resolution version, which would degrade the classroom experience.
