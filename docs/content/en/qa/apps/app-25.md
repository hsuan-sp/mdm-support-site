## Q: How do I use 'Declarative .pkg Deployment' in macOS 26? How does it differ from Jamf Policies?

## Answer

*  **macOS 26 (Tahoe) extends Declarative Device Management (DDM) to support non-App Store software (.pkg). This allows you to deploy installation packages via 'Declarations' for a more modern, transparent, and resilient installation experience compared to the legacy Jamf Binary/Policy method.**## DDM Package vs. Jamf Policy

| Feature | Jamf Policy (Legacy) | DDM Package Declaration (Modern) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|**Execution**| Relies on the `Jamf` binary to run scripts and installers. | Relies on the macOS native MDM framework. |
|**Trigger**| Requires a trigger (e.g., Login, Recurring Check-in). |**Autonomous**. Device installs as soon as conditions are met. |
|**Status Channel**| Reported through Jamf logs with potential delay. |**Real-time**reporting of progress and error codes to MDM. |
|**Offline Support**| Must be online to trigger the check-in. | If the declaration is local, the device handles install retries offline. |
|**Suitability**| Best for complex scripts and .dmg installs. | Best for standard signed**Distribution Packages (.pkg)**. |

## Requirements & Limitations***OS**: macOS 26 (Tahoe) or later.***Package Quality**:***Must be a**Distribution Package**(not a basic component pkg).***Must be**signed**with a valid Apple Developer ID Installer certificate.***Must be**notarized**by Apple. MDM deployment in macOS 26 is extremely strict regarding security; unsigned or un-notarized packages will fail with a `VerificationFailed` error in the status channel.

## When to use each?***Use DDM Packages**: For standard core software (Microsoft Office, Google Chrome, Adobe Acrobat) on macOS 26+ machines where you need high visibility of success rates.***Use Jamf Policies**: For legacy machines (v25 and below), complex workflows (requires post-install scripts or UI interaction), or non-standard installers (DMGs).

## Expert Tip: The Notarization Check

Before uploading a .pkg to Jamf for DDM deployment, run the following command on your admin Mac to ensure it will be accepted by macOS 26:
`pkgutil --check-signature path/to/your.pkg`
If the signature chain is not valid all the way to the Apple Root CA, the DDM deployment will be rejected by the client device's security framework.
