## Q: How do I prevent apps from updating during class time to avoid network congestion?

## Answer

**The key is to disable 'Automatic Updates' and adopt a 'Manual Push during Maintenance Window' strategy.** The App Store's automatic update mechanism can be unpredictable. To ensure classroom stability, use the following settings for critical apps:

## 1. Disable Automatic Updates for Specific Apps

In the app details page within Jamf Pro, **uncheck 'Automatically update app'** . Perform this for critical tools like Google Classroom, Meet, or exam apps to prevent a sudden update from introducing bugs mid-lesson.

## 2. Establish a 'Maintenance Window'

Coordinate a fixed time with the school (e.g., every Friday after 5 PM). Use Jamf Pro's **Mass Actions** to select the target device groups and manually send the **Update Application** command.

## 3. Leverage Version Pinning

If your environment uses **Volume Purchase (VPP)** , while you cannot technically "downgrade" an app, you can choose not to trigger the update command. This keeps all devices on a stable, current version until a planned upgrade during breaks.
