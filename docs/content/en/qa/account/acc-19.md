**Administrators can determine whether to allow AI features through the 'Service Access' settings in Apple School Manager (ASM).**

As Apple expands **Apple Intelligence** through 2024 and 2025, ASM provides account-level toggles that complement MDM device restrictions.

## Configuration Methods:

1. **Account Level (ASM)**: Log in to ASM > **Settings > User Management > Service Access**. Here, you can enable or disable Apple Intelligence services for specific roles (e.g., students).
2. **Device Level (MDM)**: In the Jamf Pro Restrictions profile, you can specifically disable features like "Writing Tools" or "Image Playground."

## Why configure at the account level?

If you disable the service in ASM, the student will be unable to use Apple Intelligence cloud-based features even if they sign into their Managed Apple Account on a personal, unmanaged device. This ensures the educational institution maintains absolute control over data flow.
