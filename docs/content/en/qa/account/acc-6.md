## Q: Students have graduated or left the school. How should I handle their Managed Apple Accounts?

## Answer

**It is recommended to first 'Deactivate' the account, and strictly proceed to 'Delete' only after confirming the student has completed any necessary data migration.**
**Please note that deletion is permanent and irreversible.**

The lifecycle of a Managed Apple Account should align with your school's administrative processes. Proper management ensures VPP licenses are reclaimed and complies with educational data retention regulations.

**Recommended Workflow**:
**Phase 1: Deactivate Account**

1. Log in to Apple School Manager ([school.Apple.com](https://school.Apple.com)).
2. Click**Users**in the sidebar, then search for and select the student.
3. In the details panel on the right, click**Change Account Status**(or click "Edit"/"Change" next to the status).
4. Change the status to**Deactivated**.
5. **Effects**:

*    The student will be immediately signed out of all devices and can no longer access any Apple services.
*    Data in iCloud (**200 GB free tier**) is retained on the server until the account is permanently deleted.
*    Administrators can reactivate access at any time by switching the status back to "Active".

**Phase 2: Retention Period**

It is advisable to retain accounts for 30 to 90 days after graduation. Since students cannot use the "Data and Privacy" page to download backups like personal accounts can, this period allows for temporary reactivation requests to transfer important coursework.

**Phase 3: Delete Account**

1. Select the deactivated user.
2. Click**Delete User**in the right-hand panel.
3. **Consequences**:

*    All cloud data (Drive files, Notes, Photos) associated with the account will be permanently erased.
*    Any App licenses (VPP) assigned to the user will be automatically released back to the school's license pool.

**Batch Processing for Graduates**:

1. In the**Users**list, use "Search" or "Filter" to locate students of a specific grade or class.
2. Select multiple students using keyboard shortcuts (hold**Command**or**Ctrl**, or use**Shift**for range selection).
3. Click**Change Account Status**in the panel to deactivate the entire class at once.

**Important Notes**:

* **Federated Authentication Users**: If student accounts are federated via Google or Microsoft, you should first deactivate the user in the Google/Microsoft directory, then return to ASM to check the sync status.
* **License Reclaiming**: Whenever an account is deactivated or deleted, any app licenses previously assigned to that user are automatically returned to the school.
