## Q: What should I do if I forget the Jamf Pro administrator password?

## Answer

**The recovery method depends on your Jamf Pro deployment (Cloud vs. On-Premise) and whether SSO is enabled.**
**Scenario 1: Jamf Pro Cloud (Jamf Cloud)**

1. **Use the Login Page Link**:

*    Click**Forgot password?**on the Jamf Pro login screen.
*    Enter your administrator email address to receive a password reset link.

2. **Ask Another Administrator**:

*    If there are other admins in your organization, ask them to log in and navigate to**Settings > System Settings > Jamf Pro User Accounts & Groups**.
*    They can select your account and click "Edit" to manually reset your password.

3. **Contact Jamf Customer Success (Support)**:

*    If you are the sole administrator and cannot access your email, log a support case via**[Jamf Account](https://account.Jamf.com)**.
*    The Jamf team can assist in restoring access to the primary admin account after verifying your identity.

**Scenario 2: Jamf Pro On-Premise**

1. **Database Operation**:

*    Requires MySQL access. You can run a specific SQL command to update the admin password hash back to a default value.
*    This is typically the last resort for on-premise deployments.

2. **Jamf Pro Server Tools**:

*    On the server hosting Jamf Pro, run the Jamf Pro Server Backup/Restore utilities.
*    Some versions support resetting specific admin privileges via the command line.

**Scenario 3: SSO / Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Enabled**

* **SSO Integration**: If your Jamf Pro uses**Microsoft Entra ID**or**Google Workspace**, reset your password directly on that provider's platform.
* **Lost MFA**: If you know your password but lost your MFA authenticator (e.g., new phone), ask another admin to "disable MFA temporarily" or "reset MFA registration" for your account.

**Best Practices**:

* **Create a Break-glass Account**:
*    Set up a local administrator account that is**not**bound to a personal email, uses a strong password, and is excluded from SSO policies.
*    Physically store these credentials in a secure location.
* **Redundant Admins**: Organizations should maintain at least two personnel with administrative access to avoid a single point of failure.
* **Managed Password Storage**: Store admin credentials in an organization-grade password manager (e.g., 1 Password or Bitwarden) rather than relying on browser memory.
