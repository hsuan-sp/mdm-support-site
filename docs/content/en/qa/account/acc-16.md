**Once a school verifies its domain in Apple School Manager (ASM), the system automatically identifies 'Personal Apple Accounts' registered with school email addresses and initiates a migration process.**

This process, known as handling "Domain Conflicts," is designed to protect user privacy while ensuring organizational security.

## How it Works:

1. **Identification**: After verifying your domain (e.g., `@school.edu.tw`) in ASM, Apple scans for personal Apple Accounts using that domain.
2. **Notification**: Apple automatically emails these users, informing them that the organization has claimed ownership of the domain.
3. **60-Day Grace Period**: Users have 60 days to choose:
   - **Change Personal Email**: The user changes their personal Apple Account to a private email (e.g., Gmail). All data (photos, app purchases) remains intact, but the account name changes.
   - **Release for Organization Use**: If the account was used solely for work/teaching, the user can change the email to release it, allowing the school to recreate it as a **Managed Apple Account**.

4. **Forced Release (Domain Capture)**: If the user takes no action after 60 days, Apple requires them to change their email upon their next sign-in (using a temporary `@gtempaccount.com` name). The school email is then released for the organization to use. In 2025+ versions, administrators can further automate this via the "Domain Capture" feature.

## Important Privacy Note:

School administrators **cannot** view any personal data (photos, messages, etc.) through this process. You are only reclaiming the rights to the "Account Name" (the email address), not capturing the content.

## Admin Path:

Log in to ASM > **Settings > User Management > Domains**. You can view conflict status and remaining days next to your verified domains.
