## Q: How do I use Platform SSO (PSSO) to unlock FileVault at system boot?

## Answer

*  **Starting with macOS 15 (Sequoia), Platform SSO supports deep integration with FileVault, effectively eliminating the 'dual-password' friction point during startup.**## The Solution:

Previously, even if a Mac was domain-joined, the initial FileVault unlock screen required a local password. With the Platform SSO extensions introduced in macOS 15, we can achieve:

1. **Password Synchronization**: Write network credentials (e.g., Microsoft Entra ID / Okta) directly into the FileVault unlock list.
2. **Single Sign-On Experience**: Users enter their organizational credentials at the boot screen. Once the disk is unlocked, the identity is passed through to the desktop, bypassing the second login screen.

## Technical Requirements:***System Version**: macOS 15 or later (upgrading to**macOS 26 Tahoe**is recommended for the most stable experience).***IdP Support**: Your Identity Provider must support the latest Platform SSO protocols (Microsoft Entra ID officially supported this from 2025).***MDM Configuration**: In the Jamf Pro "Single Sign-On Extensions" profile, you must enable settings for `Shared Device Keys`and`FileVault` integration.

## Benefits:

This significantly reduces support tickets caused by teachers forgetting their local Mac passwords, as they only need to remember one school-managed credential.
