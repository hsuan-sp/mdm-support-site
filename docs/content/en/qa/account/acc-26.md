## Q: How should iCloud+ features (e.g., Hide My Email, Private Relay) be managed for Managed Apple Accounts in schools?

## Answer

**As Apple expands permissions for education users, modern 'Managed Apple Accounts' now enjoy benefit from certain advanced iCloud+ privacy features. However, in a school setting, these 'Privacy Enhancements' (such as Hide My Email and iCloud Private Relay) can sometimes conflict with network management and security auditing protocols.** ## Feature Breakdown and Management Strategy

## 1. iCloud Private Relay

* **How it works** : Encrypts DNS requests and HTTP traffic, masking the user’s IP and browsing activity from the ISP and network owner.
* **School Conflict** : Bypasses school-level content filters and firewalls, making it difficult to block inappropriate content or monitor for cyberbullying.
* **MDM Recommendation** : Use the **Restrictions** payload to disable **'Allow iCloud Private Relay'** . This ensures student web traffic remains subject to the school’s safety policies.

## 2. Hide My Email

* **How it works** : Generates random email addresses that forward to the user’s primary inbox, preventing third-party apps from knowing the student’s real email.
* **School Conflict** : Can make it difficult for IT to identify which student signed up for a specific service or tool during an audit.
* **MDM Recommendation** : While less critical than Private Relay, schools can disable **'Allow Hide My Email'** if strict identity tracking is required for all approved educational apps.

## 3. iCloud Private Email Domain

* **How it works** : Allows users to set up personal domains for iCloud Mail.
* **School Conflict** : Not typically applicable to students as their domains are managed by the school.
* **MDM Recommendation** : Generally disabled by default for Managed Apple Accounts.

## Expert Insight

For student devices, maintaining **Network Visibility** is the priority. We recommend disabling **Private Relay** via MDM to ensure your Content Filtering (DNS Proxy or Network Extension) remains effective. For teacher devices, you may choose to leave these features enabled to respect professional privacy.
