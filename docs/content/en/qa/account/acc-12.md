## Q: Can I migrate to a new MDM provider without wiping device data?

## Answer

** While System Version 26 supports 'Automated MDM Migration', it remains 'strongly discouraged' in educational environments due to potential configuration conflicts. ** According to the latest updates from WWDC 25, Apple has enhanced the `MigrateDevice` command in ** Version 26 ** (iOS 26 / macOS 26 Tahoe), allowing devices to migrate silently from an old MDM to a new one. However, significant risks remain:

## 1. Educational Environment Constraints:

* ** Profile Residue ** : Non-wipe migrations often lead to residual "Restriction Profiles" or "Education Settings" from the old MDM conflicting with the new one, potentially breaking Apple Classroom.
* ** Data Integrity ** : Over time, student devices accumulate cache and temporary files. Without a clean reset, new MDM configurations may not apply correctly.
* ** License Sync ** : VPP app licenses may fail to transition smoothly, preventing subsequent updates.

## 2. Technical Context:

* Devices must be updated to ** Version 26 (iOS/iPadOS 26, macOS 26 Tahoe) ** for the most stable "wipe-free" migration experience.
* While this feature has been significantly bolstered since WWDC 2025, a clean reset remains the recommended option for complex educational deployments.

## Practical Advice:

To ensure device stability for a new semester, we prioritize the ** Return to Service (RTS) ** feature. Introduced in iOS 17 and optimized in ** Version 26 ** , RTS allows administrators to send a single command that wipes the device and automatically re-enrolls it using cached Wi-Fi credentials. Crucially, ** OS 26 supports retaining installed managed apps during the RTS process ** , providing a "clean, stable, and fully automated" transition.
