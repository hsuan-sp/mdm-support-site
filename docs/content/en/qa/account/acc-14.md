**If newly purchased devices do not appear in your MDM inventory, the most common reason is an expired 'Server Token' or unassigned devices in Apple School Manager (ASM).**

The Server Token acts as the secure bridge between ASM and Jamf Pro for hardware management (formerly known as the DEP process). It is responsible for syncing purchase serial numbers from Apple to your MDM console.

## Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Token Expiration**: Server Tokens are valid for exactly one year. Once expired, Jamf Pro cannot fetch new serial numbers or update the enrollment status of existing ones from Apple.
2. **Unassigned Devices**: New devices must be assigned to your Jamf Pro "MDM Server" within ASM before Jamf Pro can "see" them.
3. **Unaccepted Terms**: As mentioned in `acc-1`, if new Apple terms and conditions have not been accepted, Apple will suspend all ADE synchronization activities.

## How to Renew the Server Token:

1. Log in to [school.apple.com](https://school.apple.com).
2. Click your name at the bottom left > **Preferences > Your MDM Servers**.
3. Select your server and click **Download Token**.
4. Log in to Jamf Pro, go to **Settings > Global Management > Device Enrollment**.
5. Select your server instance and upload the new token file to complete the renewal.

## Synchronization Context:

- **Sync Now**: While syncing occurs periodically, you can click "Sync Now" in Jamf Pro to force an immediate refresh after assigning devices in ASM.
- **Automation Trends**: In modern OS versions, Apple has enhanced background push mechanisms. Synchronization typically occurs automatically within minutes of assignment in ASM, but "Sync Now" remains the go-to tool for manual troubleshooting.

## Practical Advice:

We recommend setting a "Default Device Assignment" in ASM for iPad and Mac. This ensures all future purchases are automatically linked to your Jamf Pro server, requiring only the annual token renewal for a fully automated hardware intake workflow.
