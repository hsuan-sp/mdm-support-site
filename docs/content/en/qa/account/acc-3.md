## Q: How do I reset a student's 'Managed Apple Account' password?

## Answer

*  **Password resets for Managed Apple Accounts are handled by administrators within Apple School Manager (ASM).**Because these are school-managed assets, students cannot use the standard "I forgot my password" link on their own.

## Individual Reset Steps:

1. Log in to [school.apple.com](https://school.apple.com).
2. Select**"Users"**from the sidebar and search for the student's name or ID.
3. Select the user from the list.
4. Click**"Reset Password"**in the right-hand panel.
5. ASM will provide a**temporary password**. Give this to the student; they will be prompted to create a new, permanent password the next time they sign in.

## Bulk Reset (Multiple Students):

1. In the**"Users"**list, filter for the specific grade or class.
2. Use keyboard shortcuts to select multiple students (Hold**Command**or**Shift**while clicking).
3. Click**"Create Sign-In Communications"**(or Reset Password) in the right-hand panel.
4. Download the results as a**PDF**or**CSV**. This file will contain a list of temporary passwords that you can print out or distribute to the teachers.

## Important Note: Federated Authentication

If your school has enabled**Federated Authentication**with Google or Microsoft (Microsoft Entra ID), you**cannot**reset passwords in ASM. Instead, you must reset the student's password in the Google Admin Console or Microsoft 365 Admin Center. The change will automatically sync to their Apple Account.
