**The consequences are severe: Your MDM system will lose the ability to manage your devices entirely.** The **Apple Push Notification service (APNs)** certificate is the "digital ID card" that allows your MDM (Jamf Pro) to talk to Apple’s servers. Every command—from installing an app to wiping a passcode—must be signed by this certificate.

## What Happens if it Expires?

- **Total Loss of Control**: Devices will not "leave" management, but they will become "unmanaged devices." You will not be able to send any new profiles, apps, or commands.
- **The Point of No Return**: If the certificate expires and you accidentally create a **new** one instead of **renewing** the old one, you will lose the link to all currently enrolled devices. You would then have to manually erase and re-enroll every single device in the school.

## How to Renew (Before Expiration):

1. **Preparation**: Log in to Jamf Pro and navigate to **Settings > Global Management > Push Certificates**. Download the **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**.
2. **Apple Portal**: Go to the [Apple Push Certificates Portal](https://identity.apple.com/pushcert).
3. **Crucial Step**: Log in with the **EXACT SAME Apple ID** used to create the original certificate. _Warning: If you use a different ID, you will create a new certificate rather than a renewal, which will break the connection to your existing iPads._
4. **Renew**: Find the certificate that matches your Jamf server, click **"Renew,"** and upload the CSR from Step 1.
5. **Download & Upload**: Download the new `.pem` certificate from Apple and upload it back into Jamf Pro.

## Institutional Advice:

- **Use a Shared Account**: Always create your push certificate using a generic school IT email (e.g., `MDM-admin@school.tp.edu.tw`) rather than a personal teacher's Apple ID.
- **Calendar Alerts**: Set multiple calendar reminders (3 months, 1 month, and 2 weeks before expiration) to ensure this task is never forgotten.
- **Keep Backup codes**: Ensure the recovery phone number and backup keys for the management Apple ID are stored in the school’s secure password manager.
