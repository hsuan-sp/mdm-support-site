## Q: The device shows 'Connection Failed' or won't update Inventory. How do I fix it?

## Answer

** This usually indicates a breakdown in communication between the device and the MDM server or Apple's services. Please check the following four core areas in order: **** Check 1: APNs Certificate Status *** Log in to Jamf Pro and navigate to ** Settings > Global Management > Push Certificates ** .
* Ensure the certificate status is ** Verified ** (or Valid).
* ** Note ** : If the certificate has expired, the MDM completely loses control over devices and it must be renewed immediately. ** Check 2: Network Connectivity & Firewall Rules ** The device needs to reach both the Jamf server and Apple's servers. Ensure the campus firewall is not blocking:

* ** Apple Push Notification service (APNs) ** :
* Hostname: ** apple.com ** and all subdomains.
* Ports: ** TCP 443, 2197, 5223 ** .
* ** Jamf Pro Server ** : Devices must be able to load your Jamf Cloud URL via HTTPS (443).
* ** Test ** : Use Safari on the device to visit [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com) and your Jamf login page to confirm connectivity. ** Check 3: Date & Time Sync ***** Time drift is the most common cause of connection failures. ** SSL/TLS encryption requires precise time.
* Check ** Settings > General > Date & Time ** on the device and ensure ** Set Automatically ** is enabled.
* If the time deviates by more than a few minutes, the device will reject the secure connection to the server. ** Check 4: MDM Profile & DDM Status ***** Check Profile ** : On the iPad, go to ** Settings > General > VPN & Device Management ** and confirm the "Management Profile" is still "Verified".
* ** Clear Pending Commands ** :

1. Open the device record in Jamf Pro.
1. Go to ** History > Management Commands ** .
1. If there are many ** Pending ** or ** Failed ** commands, click ** Cancel All Pending and Failed Commands ** .
1. Click ** Update Inventory ** in the top right to trigger a fresh sync. ** Advanced Troubleshooting ** :

If all the above are normal but updates still fail, the device's ** Declarative Device Management (DDM) ** state might be stuck. You can try restarting the device or sending a ** Blank Push ** command via Jamf to forcibly wake up the device's connection process.
