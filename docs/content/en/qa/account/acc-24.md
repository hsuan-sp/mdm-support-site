## Q: How is the iCloud storage quota managed for Managed Apple Accounts? What if a student runs out of space?

## Answer

** Managed Apple Accounts for education default to a 200GB iCloud storage quota. Administrators cannot adjust individual quotas or purchase additional space for specific users. ** ## Storage Quotas by Organization Type

* ** Education (ASM) ** : Apple provides ** 200GB ** of iCloud storage for every user (staff and students) at no additional cost.
* ** Business (ABM) ** : Defaults to 5GB. Organizations with ** Apple Business Essentials (ABE) ** may have 50GB or 200GB quotas.*Note: As of early 2026, ABE is not yet widely available in all regions (including Taiwan).*

## Handling a Full 200GB Quota

If a student's 200GB is full (often due to backing up large personal photo/video libraries), consider the following strategies:

1. ** Utilize the 'Schoolwork' App ** :

* Files submitted via the ** Schoolwork ** app (Pages, Keynote, video assignments) are managed separately from the student’s personal iCloud quota, reducing pressure on their individual space.
* Teach students to manage files effectively instead of storing all miscellaneous data in iCloud.

1. ** Cleanup and Backup (SOP) ** :

* ** Check Backup Content ** : Go to Settings > Apple Account > iCloud > iCloud Backup and disable backups for non-essential apps.
* ** Offload Photos ** : Guide students to move non-academic photos to personal devices or a school-provided Google Photos account.
* ** Purge Old Coursework ** : At the end of the semester, export important files to a school NAS or external storage and clear the iCloud space for the next term.

1. ** Alternative Cloud Services ** :

* If your school provides ** Google Workspace for Education ** or ** Microsoft 365 ** , direct students to store large static files (like long-form video projects) on Google Drive or OneDrive. Keep iCloud reserved for app syncing and current documents.

## Expert Insight

* ** Academic Opportunity ** : Use this as a chance to teach students about "Digital Decluttering" and file management. Storage is always a finite resource, and organizing data is a key digital literacy skill.
