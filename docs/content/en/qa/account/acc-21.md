## Q: Is 'moemdm' the same as 'Jamf Pro'? Why does the school need two accounts?

## Answer

**They are completely different. Jamf Pro is the actual 'Remote Control' (the management system), while moemdm is the MOE 'Dashboard' (the reporting platform).** Many school administrators find this confusing. Please clarify the following roles:

## 1. Jamf Pro (School Management Core):

* **Function** : This is where you perform daily operations, such as deploying apps, configuring Wi-Fi, resetting passcodes, and restricting student features.
* **Nature** : An active management tool. Commands are sent directly from the Jamf server to student iPads.
* **Target Users** : IT coordinators, system administrators, and teachers.

## 2. moemdm (MOE Reporting Platform):

* **Function** : This is used by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to track the "Asset Health" and "Usage Rates" of devices in the Digital Initiative project.
* **Nature** : A data aggregation and statistics platform. Changing settings in the moemdm web portal does not directly change the behavior of the iPads.
* **Integration** : moemdm connects to Jamf Pro via APIs. As long as your Jamf Pro configuration is correct, data syncs to moemdm automatically for MOE audits.

## Why the distinction?

* **Security** : The MOE does not need—and should not have—direct control over every school's individual devices (avoiding a single point of failure).
* **Autonomy** : Schools retain pedagogical autonomy (via their own Jamf instances), while the MOE performs asset auditing and performance tracking via moemdm.

## Practical Advice:

To troubleshoot a device or change apps, log in to **Jamf Pro** . To check if school KPIs have been met or to fill out end-of-term reports, log in to **moemdm** .
