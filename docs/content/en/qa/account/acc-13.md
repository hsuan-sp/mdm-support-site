**Standard Apple School Manager (ASM) accounts do not currently offer a global 'Self-Service Password Reset' toggle for end-users.** Apple maintains strict permission levels for Managed Apple Account security. Password reset logic depends on your setup:

## 1. Federated Authentication (Google / Microsoft)

- If your school uses Google or Microsoft credentials to log in, password resets are **handled entirely on the Google or Microsoft side.**
- The user simply changes their password on that platform, and the Apple Account syncs automatically. This is currently the only way to achieve true "Self-Service Reset."

## 2. Standard Managed Apple Accounts (Non-Federated)

- **Administrator Action Required**: Users cannot reset passwords via `iforgot.apple.com` (unless a recovery phone is linked, which is only supported in specific regions).
- **Authorized Roles**: Personnel with "Administrator," "Site Manager," or "People Manager" roles must manually click "Reset Password" or "Create Sign-In Information" in ASM.

## 3. Regarding Account Recovery

While Apple optimized account recovery in OS 26, the primary control for student accounts remains with the school IT administrator for security and compliance reasons.

## Practical Advice:

If your accounts are not federated, students **must contact the ICT Support Team** if they forget their password. We recommend that administrators use the batch selection feature at the start of the semester to generate PDFs or CSVs containing temporary passwords for distribution.
