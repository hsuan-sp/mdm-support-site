**Standard Policy: Not Recommended. School devices should prioritize the use of a 'Managed Apple Account' or remain signed out.**

School administrators can now configure specific restrictions via Apple School Manager (ASM) to ensure organization-owned devices can only sign in with managed accounts. Even if your device does not enforce this yet, you should be aware of the following risks.

## Why Signing in with Personal Accounts is Discouraged:

| Risk Factor               | Details                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Privacy**          | Personal photos, messages, and cloud files will automatically sync to the device. If you forget to sign out, your private data is exposed to the next user.                                     |
| **Activation Lock**       | Signing in and enabling "Find My" locks the device to your account. While admins can now release this via ASM, it adds unnecessary administrative overhead.                                     |
| **App License Conflicts** | Apps downloaded with a personal account differ in source from school VPP apps, potentially causing update failures, version conflicts, or invalid licenses.                                     |
| **Storage Limits**        | Personal accounts typically have only 5 GB of free space, whereas school-provided **Managed Apple Accounts come with 200 GB of free iCloud storage**, making them better suited for coursework. |
| **MDM Interference**      | Personal account restrictions (like Screen Time) may conflict with school MDM profiles, leading to unstable device behavior.                                                                    |

## If You Must Use Personal Apps for Teaching (Workaround):

> ⚠️ **Temporary Usage Guidelines**
>
> If you need to access specific purchases, strictly follow this "Account Separation" method:
>
> 1. **App Store Login Only**: Sign in to your personal account **only** under "Settings" > "App Store". **Do NOT** sign in at the very top of the Settings menu (iCloud).
> 2. **Disable Find My**: If prompted to enable "Find My" or iCloud Sync, select **No** or **Cancel**.
> 3. **Sign Out Immediately**: Once the required app is installed, sign out of the App Store immediately to keep the device clean.
> 4. **Notify Admin**: Some school policies automate the removal of unauthorized apps; ensure your actions comply with school regulations.
