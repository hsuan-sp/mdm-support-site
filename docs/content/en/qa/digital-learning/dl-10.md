## Q: Can students remove school management by 'Resetting' or 'DFU Restoring' the iPad?

## Answer

**No. This will only result in the loss of all local data, and the device will be forcibly re-locked into the school's MDM during setup.** Students often mistakenly believe that MDM is just an app that can be wiped by "formatting" the device. In reality, management is tied to the **Hardware Serial Number** and **Cloud Activation Servers** , not just local software.

## Technical Workflow (Why it doesn't work):

## 1. Back to the Hello Screen (Setup Assistant)

After a DFU restore or factory reset, the system is wiped and returns to the "Hello" welcome screen. The device appears new at this stage.

## 2. Cloud Verification (The Gatekeeper)

**The Crucial Moment** : When the student selects a language and connects to Wi-Fi to activate the device, the iPad's underlying system MUST report to **Apple's Activation Servers** . The server immediately checks the **Serial Number** .

## 3. Forced Recall (Chain of Trust)

Once the Apple server confirms the serial number belongs to the school via **Apple School Manager (ASM)** , it refuses to let the user set it up as a personal device. It forces the device into the **Remote Management** screen.

* **Result** : The screen will display "This iPad will be automatically configured by [Your School Name]."

## 4. The Dead End

* If the MDM is set to "Mandatory Enrollment," the student cannot skip this step.
* If the school has enabled account authentication, the student will be **stuck at the login screen** without the correct credentials, rendering the device unusable.
* Failed restore attempts can also leave the device in Recovery Mode, creating an administrative burden for the ICT Support Team.

## Practical Advice:

* **Data Disaster** : Restoring a device is almost always an irreversible operation for local data. Students will likely **permanently lose** unsynced photos, Goodnotes, and homework.
* **Administrative Burden** : When a student fails a restore attempt, they ultimately have to return the bricked device to the IT staff, who must then spend time restoring it in DFU mode and re-enrolling it for classroom use.
