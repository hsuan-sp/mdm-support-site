**The 'Network Extension URL Filtering API' introduced in iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 is a major technical upgrade for content filtering services. While schools should be aware of this development, project-assigned devices should prioritize following regional guidelines (such as the MOE's DNS Proxy or Content Filter architectures).**

## Evolution of Content Filtering Technologies

| Era            | Technology        | Advantage                                      | Limitation                                                              |
| :------------- | :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pre-iOS 15** | Per-App VPN       | High maturity.                                 | VPN icon in status bar; higher battery drain.                           |
| **iOS 16–25**  | DNS Proxy         | Lightweight; no VPN icon.                      | Limits filtering to the domain level (cannot filter specific sub-URLs). |
| **iOS 26+**    | URL Filtering API | High performance; granular; battery efficient. | Requires iOS 26 or later.                                               |

## Technical Characteristics of the iOS 26 API

### 1. Granular Filtering

- **Past**: Could only block a domain (e.g., `example.com`). All pages on that site were treated the same.
- **New API**: Can identify full URL paths (e.g., `example.com/bad-content`). This allows a school to block a specific inappropriate page while leaving the rest of the educational domain accessible.

### 2. Privacy-First Design

- **On-Device Processing**: Most filtering decisions happen locally on the device using a Bloom Filter, meaning private browsing history isn't sent to a cloud server.
- **Private Information Retrieval (PIR)**: When a cloud check is needed, it uses PIR technology so the server cannot see exactly which URL was queried.
- **Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP)**: Queries are anonymized through a relay, ensuring neither Apple nor the provider can link a query to a specific student ID.

### 3. Performance

- Integrated at the system level for faster processing and minimal impact on battery life.

## Practical Advice for Schools

If you use a service like **Jamf Trust**, the transition to this new API is typically handled automatically by the provider. IT administrators usually don't need to manually change settings. However, we recommend:

- **Testing**: When upgrading a classroom to iOS 26, verify that your regional teaching platforms (educational portals) remain accessible.

- **Battery Monitoring**: Observe if the newer API reduces "battery drain" complaints from students, as this is a common side effect of older VPN-based filters.
