## Q: How do I prevent students from signing into personal Apple Accounts and installing non-educational apps?

## Answer

**This is a fundamental control for school-owned deployments. To avoid app ownership confusion and privacy risks, you must use a 'Restrictions' profile to lock account settings and App Store access.** School-issued devices are public assets and should not allow personal account usage.

## Standard Protection Settings (Jamf Pro):

1. **Lock Account Modification (Crucial)** :

* In the **Restrictions > Functionality** section.
* **Uncheck** `Allow modifying account settings`.
* **Result** : The Apple Account section at the top of the iPad Settings menu will turn gray and become unclickable. Students will be unable to sign in or out of any account.

1. **Disable App Store** :

* **Uncheck** `Allow installing apps using App Store`.
* **Result** : The App Store icon will disappear from the Home Screen entirely.
* **Management** : All apps should be pushed via the MDM using **Volume Purchase (VPP)** with Device-based Assignment.
