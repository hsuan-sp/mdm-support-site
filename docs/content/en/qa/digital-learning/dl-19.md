## Q: Troubleshooting: Apple Classroom keeps losing student connections or showing 'Offline'.

## Answer

** Apple Classroom is highly dependent on 'Bluetooth Proximity' and 'Peer-to-Peer Interoperability'. If connections fail, follow this three-stage checklist. ** As an IT Coordinator, first eliminate front-end environment issues before escalating network-layer problems to higher-level authorities.

## Phase 1: Local Device Check (Most Common)

1. ** Bluetooth Permissions ** : Ensure Bluetooth is enabled on both teacher and student devices. In ** iOS 26 ** , go to ** Settings > Privacy & Security > Bluetooth ** and confirm the "Classroom" app permission is toggled ** ON ** .

1. ** Same Wi-Fi SSID ** : Verify both the teacher and student are on the exact same SSID (e.g., `School-Wi-Fi`). Even if they are on different radio bands (2.4G/5G), using different SSIDs can sometimes lead to client isolation.

1. ** App State ** : If a student's iPad is asleep or locked, the teacher will see them as offline. Ask students to unlock their screens and try again.

## Phase 2: MDM Profile Check

* ** Education Profile ** : Go to ** Settings > General > VPN & Device Management ** and verify the "Education Profile" is present and has not expired.
* ** Inventory Update ** : If the roster is incorrect, send an ** Update Inventory ** command to the class in Jamf Pro to force a re-sync of the educational configuration.

## Phase 3: School Network Environment

* If the devices are local and configured correctly but still won't talk, the Wi-Fi infrastructure is likely blocking ** mDNS (Bonjour) ** .
* ** Action ** : IT coordinators often cannot fix this at the school level. Contact your regional network center or vendor and request that they allow ** mDNS Relay ** and open ** TCP/UDP Ports 3283 and 3284 ** . Ensure "Client Isolation" is disabled for the classroom VLAN.

## Practical Advice:

If connection issues only occur in specific rooms, check if that specific Access Point (AP) is overloaded or has a firmware issue causing packet drops.
