## Q: How do I transfer 'Digital Initiative' iPads from graduating students to new students?

## Answer

**Utilize the 'Return to Service (Return to Service)' feature to achieve a seamless transition from 'Wipe' to 'Redeploy' without manual Wi-Fi configuration.**

Graduation season is a major event for device management. We recommend the following automated workflow:

## Standard Operating Procedure (SOP):

1. **Backup for Graduates (T-minus 2 weeks)**:

*    Notify students to export personal photos and projects to Google Drive or external storage.
*    Encourage students to manually sign out of personal Apple or Google accounts to avoid cloud-lock disputes (though MDM can forcibly clear the device).

2. **Execute Return to Service (Recommended)**:

*    Select the graduate devices in Jamf Pro.
*    Send the**Wipe Device**command.
* **Crucial Step**: Check**Return to Service**in the command options and specify the school's Wi-Fi profile.
* **Result**: The device will erase, automatically reconnect to Wi-Fi, skip initial setup, and land on the "Remote Management" screen awaiting the new student.

3. **Physical Inspection & Cleaning**:

*    Inspect hardware for damage. Clean using 75% ethyl alcohol wiped onto a cloth (avoid direct spraying).
*    For summer storage, maintain battery levels between 50%-60% and power the device off to prevent deep discharge.

4. **Issuance to New Students**:

*    New students power on the device to see the "Remote Management" screen. They follow the updated PreStage Enrollment settings (e.g., login with student ID) to complete activation.
