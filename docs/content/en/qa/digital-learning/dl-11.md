## Q: How do I transfer 'Digital Initiative' iPads from graduating students to new students?

## Answer

** Utilize the 'Return to Service (RTS)' feature to achieve a seamless transition from 'Wipe' to 'Redeploy' without manual Wi-Fi configuration. ** Graduation season is a major event for device management. We recommend the following automated workflow:

## Standard Operating Procedure (SOP):

1. ** Backup for Graduates (T-minus 2 weeks) ** :

* Notify students to export personal photos and projects to Google Drive or external storage.
* Encourage students to manually sign out of personal Apple or Google accounts to avoid cloud-lock disputes (though MDM can forcibly clear the device).

1. ** Execute Return to Service (Recommended) ** :

* Select the graduate devices in Jamf Pro.
* Send the ** Wipe Device ** command.
* ** Crucial Step ** : Check ** Return to Service ** in the command options and specify the school's Wi-Fi profile.
* ** Result ** : The device will erase, automatically reconnect to Wi-Fi, skip initial setup, and land on the "Remote Management" screen awaiting the new student.

1. ** Physical Inspection & Cleaning ** :

* Inspect hardware for damage. Clean using 75% ethyl alcohol wiped onto a cloth (avoid direct spraying).
* For summer storage, maintain battery levels between 50%-60% and power the device off to prevent deep discharge.

1. ** Issuance to New Students ** :

* New students power on the device to see the "Remote Management" screen. They follow the updated PreStage Enrollment settings (e.g., login with student ID) to complete activation.
