## Q: Maintenance: The Digital Initiative contract ends in 2026. What should I do if iPads fail or die?

## Answer

**As the Digital Initiative enters its final contract year, hardware failures will reach their peak. If a device shows no signs of accidental damage, you must report it early to secure a replacement or repair before the contract expires.** After four years of high-intensity classroom use, various internal components in the initial iPad 9 batch are reaching their natural limit. IT Coordinators should audit their fleet for the following:

## Common Hardware Failure Categories:

1. **Power Issues** :

* **No Power** : Typically a motherboard power management IC or CPU rail failure.
* **Charging Failure** : Aging battery modules, charging IC damage, or physical wear inside the Lightning port.
* **Battery Swelling** : The screen is physically pushing away from the frame. This is a safety risk—report immediately.

1. **Display and Connectivity** :

* **Screen Lines** : LCD ribbon cable aging, causing static lines or flickering.
* **Functional Failure** : Wi-Fi toggle grayed out, Bluetooth failure, or gyroscope (accelerometer) damage preventing screen rotation.

## Warranty and Replacement Rights:

* **Non-Accidental Damage** : As long as the device is physically intact (no cracked screen, no bent frame, no major impact dents), these failures are usually classified as "Natural Hardware Failure" and are covered by the warranty and maintenance contract.
* **Act Fast** : If you find these issues, contact us immediately. During the maintenance period, if a failure is deemed non-accidental, the school should exercise its right to a **Replacement Unit** to ensure classroom sets remain full.

## Using Jamf Pro for Your Audit:

1. **Lost Connection Filter** : Create a Smart Group where the "Last Inventory Update" is more than 30 days ago. These devices are likely dead, uncharged, or experiencing network failure.

1. **Hardware Health** : Review the `Wi-Fi Address` field in the device record. if it shows `Unknown` or other anomalies, the hardware requires physical inspection.

## Practical Advice:

Audit your entire fleet by **Summer 2026** . Once the maintenance contract expires, subsequent repairs will fall back on the school’s independent budget. Ensure all public assets are functional while the protection of the initiative's contract is still in place.
