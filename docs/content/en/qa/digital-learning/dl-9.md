## Q: Does MDM monitor the student's location (GPS) at all times?

## Answer

** No. Apple's privacy architecture strictly limits MDM's location permissions. Under normal conditions, schools cannot obtain a device's GPS coordinates. ** ## The Only Exception: Lost Mode

Administrators can only trigger location tracking if a device is specifically marked as "Lost."

## Privacy Comparison Table:

| Status | Administrator Access | Student Notification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ** Normal Usage ** | ** Cannot Locate ** | None |
| ** Lost Mode Enabled ** | ** Can Get One-time Coordinates ** | Lock screen displays "This iPad is lost..." |
| ** Lost Mode Disabled ** | ** Location Stops Immediately ** | Notification shows "MDM located this device" |

## Practical Advice:

* School MDM ** cannot see ** a student's photos, messages, or browsing history (it can only filter domains, not see specific page content).
* The location feature is used solely for "asset recovery," never for monitoring a student's movements after school hours. This complies with GDPR and national cybersecurity standards.
