**This is usually because the iPad has 'Private Wi-Fi Address' enabled, preventing the school firewall or DHCP server from identifying the device by its hardware MAC address.**

## Technical Background:

The Private Address feature was introduced in iOS 14. Starting with **iOS 18**, it is further categorized as:

- **Fixed**: Uses a consistent random address for a specific Wi-Fi network (Default).

- **Rotating**: Changes the address approximately every two weeks. This high security level often causes campus network systems (which rely on MAC binding) to fail.

## MDM Solution (Universal Disable):

Administrators should not ask students to adjust this one-by-one. Instead, use Jamf Pro to push a unified Wi-Fi profile:

1. In Jamf Pro, go to **Configuration Profiles > Wi-Fi**.

2. In the **Private Wi-Fi Address** (or "MAC Address Randomization") option, select **Disabled**.
3. **Result**: When the iPad connects to this SSID, it is forced to use its real hardware MAC address, allowing network infrastructure (like MAC authentication and security logs) to function correctly.

## Practical Advice:

This setting only applies to Wi-Fi networks deployed via MDM profiles. If a student manually joins a Wi-Fi network, they must still manually go to **Settings > Wi-Fi > (i) Icon** to disable the Private Address.
