## Q: Integration Recommendations for New iPads (M4/A17 Pro) in the Digital Learning Project (2024–2026)?

## Answer

*  **Many schools have purchased newer iPad models (e.g., M4 iPad Pro, M2 iPad Air, iPad mini 7) during the project period (2022–2026) due to class expansion, hardware failure, or specific requirements. These newer models have significant hardware differences compared to the base iPad 9 used in the primary project fleet. Mixed management requires attention to accessory compatibility, charging logistics, and MDM configurations.**## Key Integration Considerations

## 1. Accessory Compatibility (The Apple Pencil Gap)***The Conflict**: The Apple Pencil (1st Gen) and (2nd Gen) used with older project devices are**not compatible**with the M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air.***Recommendation**: Ensure that procurement for new M4/M2 units includes the**Apple Pencil Pro**or**Apple Pencil (USB-C)**. Label these styluses clearly to prevent students from trying to pair the wrong pencil with the wrong iPad.

## 2. Charging and Power Logistics***The Conflict**: Older iPad 9 units use Lightning cables (USB-A to Lightning), while all new models (A17 Pro / M-series) use**USB-C**.***Infrastructure Impact**: Existing charging carts may need cable replacements. We recommend "Hybrid Carts" where specifically marked slots are equipped with USB-C cables for the newer high-performance units.

## 3. High-Performance Features in MDM***The Conflict**: New M-series iPads support features like**External Display Support (Stage Manager)**and**Windowed Apps (iPadOS 26)**that the iPad 9 does not.***Recommendation**: Use**Smart Groups**in Jamf Pro to move M-series iPads into a "High-Performance Group." Enable Stage Manager and Windowed Apps for these students to allow for more advanced creative projects while keeping the standard iPad 9 fleet on a simplified single-app interface.

## 4. Apple Intelligence Management***The Conflict**: Only the newer M-series and A17 Pro iPads support**Apple Intelligence**.***Recommendation**: Schools must decide on the AI policy specifically for these newer units (e.g., enabling Writing Tools for advanced students while disabling it during exams). Use MDM Restrictions to target only these "AI-capable" models.

## Expert Advice

When managing a mixed fleet, labeling is your best friend. Use laser engraving or color-coded protective cases to distinguish between "Standard Project iPads" (iPad 9) and "High-Performance Creative iPads" (M-series). This helps teachers quickly identify which students have access to the newer iPadOS 26 pro features.
