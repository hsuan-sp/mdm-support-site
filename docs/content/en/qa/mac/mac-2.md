## Q: How do we manage Local Admin privileges for staff and students on Macs?

## Answer

*  **The Gold Standard is to provide "Standard User" accounts for daily tasks, supplemented by a "just-in-time" Admin elevation tool or a Managed LAPS solution.**Granting permanent Admin rights to students or teachers is a major security risk. It allows for the disabling of security software, the installation of unauthorized apps, and makes the campus network more vulnerable to ransomware.

## The Three-Tier Management Strategy:

1. **Standard User by Default**:***All school-issued Macs should be set up with "Standard User" accounts. This prevents users from altering core system settings or installing system-wide software without oversight.**2.**Native LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution)**:***As of**macOS 26**, Apple includes a native LAPS protocol.***How it works**: Jamf Pro creates a hidden admin account on every Mac. The password for this account is a long, random string that**rotates automatically**every few days.***Operational use**: If a technician needs to fix a Mac, they look up the**current**random password in the Jamf dashboard. Once used, the password is refreshed, ensuring the old one can never be used again.

1. **Self-Service Elevation (Privileges App)**:***For staff members who occasionally need to install a printer driver or specialized software**:***Tool**: Deploy the**Privileges**app (or Jamf’s equivalent).***Workflow**: The teacher clicks a lock icon in the Dock, justifies the need, and is granted**Admin rights for 20 minutes**. After the timer expires, the system automatically demotes them back to a Standard User.

## Institutional Advice:

Adopting the**"Principle of Least Privilege"**does not mean making life difficult for teachers; it means providing them with the tools to be productive while ensuring the school’s digital assets remain secure and compliant with insurance standards.
