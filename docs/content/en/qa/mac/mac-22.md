**macOS 26 (Tahoe) has been confirmed as the final major version of macOS to support Intel-based Macs. Starting with macOS 27 in 2027, the operating system will exclusively support Apple Silicon (M1–M5 series).**

## Support Roadmap and Retirement Timeline

### 1. The Last Supported Intel Macs

- **iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2020)**: The peak of Intel Mac performance.
- **MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019)**.
- **Mac Pro (2019+)**.
- **Note**: Older models (2017 and prior) are already unsupported by modern macOS versions and can only run older system versions.

### 2. macOS 27 (Expected Late 2026/2027)

- Exclusively supports Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4/M5).
- Intel Macs will be unable to upgrade.

## Lifecycle Expectations

### 1. Security Updates

- After macOS 26 stops receiving major feature updates, Apple typically provides **2-3 additional years of Security Updates**.
- We expect Intel Macs on macOS 26 to be safe for school use until approximately **late 2028 or early 2029**.

### 2. App Support

- Major developers (Adobe, Microsoft, Google) usually support the current OS plus two versions back.
- Once security updates for macOS 26 cease, these vendors will likely stop releasing Intel-compatible versions or updates.

## Assessing Existing Intel Macs

### 1. Audit via MDM

Use Jamf Pro to identify all Intel-based Macs:

- Create a **Smart Computer Group**.
- Criteria: `Architecture Type` is `x86_64`.

### 2. Impact assessment by Scenario

| Scenario                 | Impact Assessment                                                               |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Professional Labs**    | Software vendors may gradually phase out Intel support.                         |
| **Administrative Tasks** | Office and browsers have lower requirements; usable until security updates end. |
| **Teacher Laptops**      | Depends on specific software requirements.                                      |

## Timeline Summary

- **2026–2027**: Intel Macs running macOS 26 remain fully functional with security patches.
- **2027–2028**: Third-party software support begins to dwindle.
- **2029+**: Security updates end; devices should be replaced or used for non-networked tasks.

## Why Apple Silicon?

- M1-M5 series offer revolutionary performance and battery life over Intel.
- macOS and core apps are optimized for the Apple Silicon architecture.
- Native support for running iOS/iPadOS apps.
