## Q: macOS 26: The end of the Intel Mac era. How much longer can Intel Macs be used?

## Answer

**macOS 26 (Tahoe) has been confirmed as the final major version of macOS to support Intel-based Macs. Starting with macOS 27 in 2027, the operating system will exclusively support Apple Silicon (M1–M5 series).** ## Timeline and Support Expectations

1. **The Last Supported Intel Macs** :

* iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2020)
* MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019)
* Mac Pro (2019) ** Note: Older models (2017 and prior) are already unsupported by macOS 26.*

1. **OS Support Lifecycle** :

* **2026–2027** : Intel Macs running macOS 26 remain fully functional with all current security patches.
* **2027–2029** : While macOS 27 will not install, Apple typically provides **2 additional years of Security Updates** for the previous version. We expect Intel Macs on macOS 26 to be safe for school use until approximately **late 2028 or early 2029** .

1. **Software App Support** :

* Major developers (Adobe, Microsoft, Google) usually support the current OS plus two versions back. Once security updates for macOS 26 cease in 2029, these vendors will likely stop releasing Intel-compatible versions of their software.

## Advice for School IT Managers:

* **Inventory Audit** : Use your MDM (Jamf Pro) to identify all Intel-based Macs. Set a "Retirement Target" of **Summer 2028** .
* **Performance Gap** : Native Apple Silicon features (like on-device AI, high-efficiency video encoding, and iPhone Mirroring) are increasingly crippled or unavailable on Intel hardware.
* **Procurement** : For any new purchases in 2026, **avoid second-hand Intel Macs** regardless of the price. The transition to M4/M5 Mac mini or MacBook Air is essential for long-term curriculum compatibility.
