**macOS 26 introduces the ability to unlock FileVault at the 'Pre-boot' stage via SSH, solving a major pain point for headless server management.**

## The Problem:

Historically, a Mac with FileVault enabled would stop at the login screen after a reboot, before the network or remote access services started. This required physical keyboard access to unlock and "lost" the machine to remote admins.

## Requirements:

1. **Remote Login** : Must be enabled in System Settings > General > Sharing.

1. **Network** : A hardwired Ethernet connection is most reliable for Pre-boot networking.

1. **Authorization** : The SSH user must be a FileVault-enabled user.

1. **OS** : macOS 26 or later.

## Remote Unlock Command:

From a remote terminal:
`SSH -o PreferredAuthentications=password -o PubkeyAuthentication=no username@mac-ip`

After entering the password, the SSH session will momentarily drop as the encryption keys are released and the system finishes its boot sequence.

## 2026 Safety Warning (M5 Macs):

On **M5 Silicon** Macs, Apple has tightened **Secure Enclave** protections.

- If you have enabled "Lockdown Mode" or "Advanced Data Protection," the Pre-boot SSH stack may be crippled for safety.
- **Recommendation** : For server-room units requiring remote telemetry, ensure these high-restriction security toggles are managed carefully via MDM to allow the network stack to initialize.
