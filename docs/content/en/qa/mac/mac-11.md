## Q: Why does my Mac show 'Unidentified Developer' or 'Cannot be opened' when installing software?

## Answer

*  **This is macOS's Gatekeeper security mechanism. For software required for teaching that has not been notarized by Apple, we recommend using 'Right-click to Open' or deploying via MDM to bypass quarantine flags.**Apple requires all macOS software to undergo**Notarization**to ensure it is free of malicious code. If software is older or the developer is not registered with Apple, it will be blocked.

## User-Side Solutions (SOP):

## Option 1: Right-click to Open (Single Override)

This is the standard way to bypass the block without lowering overall system security.

1. Find the app in**Finder**.
2. Hold the**Control**key (or right-click) and select**Open**.
3. The resulting dialog will now include an**Open**button. Once selected, the system adds this app to a local allowlist.

## Option 2: System Settings Override

1. When the block message appears, click "OK."
2. Go to**System Settings > Privacy & Security**.
3. Under the "Security" section, look for "[App Name] was blocked" and click**Open Anyway**.
4. Authenticate with an administrator password to run the app.

## Administrator Solutions (Jamf Pro):

## Strategy 1: Deploy via Policy (Recommended)

When software is installed via a Jamf Pro Policy, it is written by the Jamf Binary with Root privileges. This typically**does not**apply the "Download Quarantine" attribute (`com.Apple.quarantine`), allowing the app to open without a Gatekeeper warning.

## Strategy 2: Remove Quarantine Attribute via Script

If software was downloaded or copied manually, you can use a Jamf script to strip the quarantine flag:

```bash

# Remove quarantine attribute for a specific app

xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/AppName.app
```

## Practical Advice:

If you see a message stating the app is**"Damaged and should be moved to the Trash,"**it often isn't actually corrupt. Instead, its signing certificate may have expired or it hasn't been notarized. Using the script command above often resolves this issue.
