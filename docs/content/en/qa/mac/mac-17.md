**The Mac mini (M4/M5), paired with macOS 26, offers 'Zero-Touch Deployment' and extreme energy efficiency, making it the ideal PC replacement for modern schools.**

## Why Administrators Choose Mac mini:

1. **Zero-Wipe Migration** :

- **Traditional PC** : Requires "Ghosting" or heavy image deployment via network.
- **Mac mini (M5)** : Supports **Zero-Wipe MDM Migration** in macOS 26. This means if you change MDM providers, you can migrate the machine's ownership "in place" without wiping the drive or reinstalling educational software.
- **ADE Automation** : Unbox, plug in, and the machine automatically installs Office, Adobe, and network settings based on its serial number.

1. **Space and Energy Efficiency** :

- The M4/M5 Mac mini has a tiny footprint (approx. 12.7cm wide) and can be mounted behind monitors.
- Its power consumption is significantly lower than a traditional PC, reducing long-term school electricity costs.

1. **Local AI Readiness** :

- The M4/M5 chips feature a powerful Neural Engine (NPU), capable of running local AI models and 4K video editing without relying on cloud credits, perfectly aligning with modern digital curricula.
