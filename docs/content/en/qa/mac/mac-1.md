## Q: Should we still bind our Macs to Active Directory (AD)? What is the modern recommendation?

## Answer

*  **We strongly recommend a "No-Bind" strategy. Instead of traditional AD binding, schools should adopt Platform SSO or Jamf Connect.**The traditional method of "Binding" a Mac to a Domain Controller (DC) is increasingly unreliable in a modern campus environment characterized by mobile laptops and Zero Trust security.

## Why Move Away from AD Binding?***Mobility Barriers**: If a teacher takes their MacBook home, they are disconnected from the DC. This often causes slow logins or failures when trying to sync password changes made on campus.***Keychain Synchronization Issues**: When an AD password is changed, the local Mac "Keychain" often falls out of sync, leading to constant and frustrating password prompts for the user.***Legacy Technology**: Apple is no longer actively developing the AD Plugin. Modern macOS management is built around Cloud Identity Providers (IdP).

## Modern Alternatives for 2026:

## Option A: Platform SSO 2.0 (The Standard for macOS 26 Tahoe)

Introduced in macOS 13 and fully matured in**macOS 26**, Platform SSO is the Apple-native way to link your Cloud ID (Google, Microsoft Entra ID) to the local Mac login.***Simplified Setup**: During the out-of-box "Setup Assistant," the Mac requires the student to log in with their campus ID, which then automatically creates their local account.***Seamless Sync**: The local Mac password is kept perfectly in sync with the cloud password.***Passwordless Future**: macOS 26 supports authorized logins using Face ID or Touch ID, significantly reducing "forgotten password" tickets.

## Option B: Jamf Connect

For schools requiring more granular control or custom branding (e.g., displaying the school logo and Acceptable Use Policy on the login screen).***Just-in-Time Provisioning**: It creates the local account the first time a user logs in with their cloud credentials.***Enforced Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: You can require students or staff to pass an MFA check (phone app or security key) before they can even reach the Mac desktop.

## Institutional Advice:

If your school still has a large fleet of AD-bound Macs, we recommend a phased "Unbind" project. Migrating to**Platform SSO**will drastically reduce the support burden associated with "Password Desynchronization" and login delays.
