## Q: How do I push system updates via Jamf Pro? Can I set a deadline for enforced installation?

## Answer

**By 2026, software update management in Jamf Pro has fully transitioned to the "Declarative Device Management (DDM)" framework.** This approach is more stable than legacy remote commands and allows devices to autonomously handle the download and installation process, significantly reducing server load.

## 1. Using "Software Update Blueprints"

This is the recommended and most professional method:

1. Navigate to **`Settings` > `Device Management` > `Software Update Blueprints`** .
1. Click `New` and set the target version (e.g., iOS 26.x or macOS 26 Tahoe).

1. **Key Setting: Enforcement Deadline** :

* Set a specific date and time (e.g., Three days from now at 5:00 PM).
* Before the deadline, users will receive gentle system notifications.
* **Once the deadline is reached, the device will ignore the user's state, force a restart, and install the update.** 1. Assign this blueprint to the target device group.

## 2. Using Mass Actions for Remote Commands (Legacy Way)

If you need to send an update immediately to a specific set of search results:

1. On the search results page for `Mobile Devices` or `Computers`, click **`Action`** at the bottom right.
1. Choose **`Send Remote Commands`** .
1. Select **"Update OS version on supervised devices"** from the list.
1. On the **"Update OS Options"** page, choose your desired settings:

* **Target Version** : Recommended to select "Latest version based on device eligibility."
* **Action** :
* **Download the update for users to install** : The device will pre-download the files, and students can install them at their convenience.
* **Download and install the update, and restart devices after installation** : This forces the update immediately; ideal for scheduling after school hours.

## 3. Management Highlights for 2026: macOS 26 Tahoe and Intel Macs

* **Legacy Support** : macOS 26 is the final version to support Intel-based Macs. For these older devices, allow double the download time and ensure the **Bootstrap Token** is correctly escrowed.
* **DDM Autonomy** : In the latest systems, devices use DDM declarations to automatically perform updates when connected to power and idle (e.g., overnight), with much higher success rates than traditional push commands.

## Best Practices:

* **Avoid Exam Weeks** : While updates can be enforced, avoid doing so during exam periods or presentations to prevent devices from entering the 15–30 minute update screen unexpectedly.
* **Power Confirmation** : Remind students to plug in their iPad/Mac overnight when an update is scheduled. Constant power is the most critical factor for a successful update.
