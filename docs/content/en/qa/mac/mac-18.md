**If the Mac is a school asset (enrolled in ASM), administrators can bypass Activation Lock directly from the Apple School Manager portal without the original user's password.**

This is a critical failsafe for when staff leave or students graduate without signing out of their personal accounts.

## Standard Recovery SOP:

1. **Log in to ASM**: Use your administrator account at [school.apple.com](https://school.apple.com).
2. **Search Device**: Click **Devices** in the sidebar and enter the Mac's serial number.
3. **Execute Unlock**:
   - Locate the **Activation Lock** status in the details pane.
   - Click **Turn Off** or **Clear Unlock Code**.

4. **Reset Device**:
   - Wait a few minutes for the command to propagate.
   - Put the Mac into **Recovery Mode** and reinstall macOS. The lock screen will no longer appear.

## Prerequisites:

- The device must be part of your **Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)** pool and assigned to your MDM.
- For older machines purchased outside the project, they must have been added to ASM via Apple Configurator for this feature to work.
