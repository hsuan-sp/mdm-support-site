## Q: Default Jamf Pro inventory lacks specific info (like file versions or last reboot). How do I collect custom data?

## Answer

*  **Use the "Computer Extension Attributes" feature. This is the core tool in Jamf Pro for expanding database fields and collecting non-standard hardware/software information.**While standard inventory includes specs, OS versions, and app lists, specific needs (such as checking if a config file was tampered with, battery cycle counts, or custom asset tags) require Extension Attributes.

## 2026 Model: DDM Status Channel

In addition to traditional inventory updates, macOS 26 recommends using the DDM Status Channel:***Real-time**: When a state changes (e.g., CPU load, disk space, FileVault status), the device actively reports to Jamf Pro rather than waiting for the next scheduled scan.***Low Load**: Only changed fields are reported, significantly reducing server overhead.***Recommendation**: For fields where accuracy is critical (e.g., whether security software is running), prioritize the DDM Status Channel.

## Setup Steps (SOP):

1. **Navigate**: Go to**Settings > Computer Management > Extension Attributes**.
2. **Add**: Click**+ New**.
3. **Configure**:***Display Name**: e.g., "Last Reboot Time".***Input Type**: Select**Script**.***Data Type**: String, Integer, or Date. This affects Smart Group logic (e.g., "greater than/less than" vs. "contains").

1. **Write Script**:***Paste your Shell Script in the editor.*****Crucial Syntax**: Jamf Pro only reads values enclosed in `<result>`and`</result>`tags. Any other`echo` output will only appear in debug logs and won't be written to the database.

## Practical Example: Collecting "System Uptime Days"

```bash

#!/bin/bash

# Get system uptime days and report to Jamf Pro

# Uses awk to grab the 'days' part of the uptime command output

days=$(uptime | awk '{ print $3 }')
echo "<result>$days</result>"
```

## Advanced Application Scenarios:***Compliance Check**: Use a script to check if a security daemon (like CrowdStrike or SentinelOne) is running. If it returns "Stopped," the computer can automatically fall into a "Non-Compliant Group" and trigger a remediation policy.***Administrative Management**: Set Input Type to**Pop-up Menu**for fields like "Department" (e.g., Academic, Administrative, IT). This allows admins to manually assign units during device issuance for easier group management.

## Practical Advice: Expert Tips***Execution Performance**: Extension Attribute scripts run during**every**inventory update. Avoid time-consuming scripts (like `find /` scanning the whole drive), as they can slow down inventory reporting across the school or cause system lag.
