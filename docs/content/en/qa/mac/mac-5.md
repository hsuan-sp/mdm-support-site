**The modern solution is to use "Declarative Device Management (DDM)." If you need more visual urgency, you can supplement this with the open-source tool "Nudge."** Unlike iPads, Mac updates often require a lengthy restart, which leads students to postpone them indefinitely, creating a fragmented and insecure fleet.

## Path 1: DDM Enforced Updates (Recommended for macOS 14+)

* **The Logic** : You set an **"Enforcement Deadline."**

*** The Experience** :

1. In the days leading up to the deadline, the system gently notifies the student.
1. As the deadline approaches, the notifications become more persistent.

1. **Once the deadline is reached** , the Mac will automatically download the update and force a restart. The student cannot postpone it further.

* **Configuration** : This is set in Jamf Pro under **Configuration Profiles > Software Update** , where you define the target version and the specific cut-off date and time.

## Path 2: Nudge (Visual Urgency)

* If the subtle system notifications aren't enough, **Nudge** is the industry standard for gettings users to take action.
* **The Experience** : It pops up a non-dismissible window (which can be branded with the school logo) that clearly states: "Your Mac is out of date and insecure. Please update now."
* **Escalation** : As the deadline nears, Nudge can dim the screen or blur the background, making it impossible for the student to ignore the update while they try to use other apps.

## Institutional Advice:

For computer labs that are unoccupied at night, use Jamf Pro to schedule a "Wake Up" command at 2:00 AM followed by a "Force Update" command. This allows the heavy lifting to happen while the students are asleep, ensuring the labs are ready and updated for the first period.
