**The modern solution is to use "Declarative Device Management (DDM)."** If you need more visual urgency, you can supplement this with the open-source tool "Nudge."

Unlike iPads, Mac updates often require a lengthy restart, which leads students to postpone them indefinitely, creating a fragmented and insecure fleet.

## Strategy 1: DDM Enforced Updates (Recommended for macOS 14+)

- **The Logic**: This is Apple's newest management protocol. IT administrators set an **"Enforcement Deadline."**
- **The Workflow**:
  1. In the days leading up to the deadline, the system gently notifies the student.
  2. As the deadline approaches, the notifications become more persistent.
  3. **Once the deadline is reached**, the Mac will automatically download the update and force a restart. The student cannot postpone it further.
- **Configuration**: This is set in Jamf Pro under **Configuration Profiles > Software Update**, where you define the target version and the specific cut-off date and time.

## Strategy 2: Nudge (Visual Urgency)

If the subtle system notifications aren't enough, the community-standard tool **Nudge** is the best solution.

- **Functionality**: It pops up a non-dismissible window (which can be branded with the school logo) that clearly states: "Your Mac is out of date and insecure. Please update now."
- **Escalation**: As the deadline nears, Nudge can dim the screen or blur the background, making it impossible for the student to ignore the update while they try to use other apps.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the Nudge package and JSON configuration via Jamf Pro.

## Institutional Advice:

For computer labs that are unoccupied at night, use Jamf Pro to schedule a "Wake Up" command at 2:00 AM followed by a "Force Update" command. This allows the heavy lifting to happen while the students are asleep, ensuring the labs are ready and updated for the first period.
