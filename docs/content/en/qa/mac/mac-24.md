**Safari in macOS 26 introduces 'Distraction Control,' which allows users to hide specific web elements (like ads or sidebars). However, in a Computer-Based Testing (CBT) environment, students could abuse this to hide timers, navigation menus, or proctoring warnings.**

## I. Risk Scenarios

- **Practice Mode**: Students hide "Hints" or "Rules."
- **Official Testing**: Students hide the "Remaining Time (Countdown)" to claim they didn't know the exam was ending, or hide the "Proctoring Status Label."

## II. MDM Management Solutions (SOP)

IT coordinators should enforce the following settings via Jamf Pro during major exams:

### 1. Lock via Configuration Profile (Recommended)

- **Domain**: `com.apple.Safari` advanced settings.
- **Setting**: `AllowDistractionControl` = `false`
- **Effect**: The "Distraction Control" option in the Safari menu will be grayed out and unavailable, ensuring the website UI remains exactly as intended by the test publisher.

### 2. Assessment Mode (AAC)

For high-stakes exams, use a specialized testing app or a managed browser that invokes Apple's **'Automatic Assessment Configuration (AAC).'**

- This mode forces the device into a secure workspace, automatically disabling non-essential features including Distraction Control, Siri, notifications, and multitasking.

## III. Operational Advice

1. **Smart Group Segmentation**: Create a "Testing Mode" group and push the restriction profile only 15 minutes before the exam begins.
2. **Script Verification**: Use an Extension Attribute to verify that the Safari `DistractionControl` override is successfully active before the exam starts.

**Administrator's Insight**: While "Distraction Control" improves daily reading efficiency, it represents a significant loophole for proctoring in school assessment scenarios. We recommend evaluating it alongside the "Safari Translation" feature for potential disabling during tests.
