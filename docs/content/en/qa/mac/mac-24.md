## Q: Exam Security: Managing Safari 'Distraction Control' to prevent cheating during web-based tests.

## Answer

** Safari in macOS 26 introduces 'Distraction Control,' which allows users to hide specific web elements (like ads or sidebars). However, in a Computer-Based Testing (CBT) environment, students could abuse this to hide timers, navigation menus, or proctoring warnings. ** ## Risks in the Classroom:

* ** Hiding the Clock ** : A student hides the countdown timer and then claims they didn't know the exam was ending.
* ** Hiding Instructions ** : Students could hide critical rules or "Hints" buttons that are part of the testing UI.

## Management Solutions (SOP):

1. ** MDM Configuration Profile (Recommended) ** :

* ** Domain ** : `com.apple.Safari`.
* ** Payload ** : Set `AllowDistractionControl` to `false`.
* ** Effect ** : The "Distraction Control" option in the Safari menu will be grayed out and unavailable, ensuring the website UI remains exactly as intended by the test publisher.

1. ** Assessment Mode (AAC) ** :

* For high-stakes exams, use a specialized testing app or a managed browser that invokes Apple’s ** 'Assessment Mode.' ***** Effect ** : This automatically suppresses Distraction Control, Siri, notifications, and all multitasking features without needing a specific configuration profile.

## IT Strategy:

Create a ** "Testing Mode" Smart Group ** in Jamf Pro. Use a script to verify that `DistractionControl` is disabled 15 minutes before the exam begins. We recommend also disabling Safari "Translation" features during the same period to prevent unapproved language assistance.
