## Q: Classroom Order: How to manage or disable 'iPhone Mirroring' to prevent student distractions.

## Answer

** macOS 26 provides granular MDM controls for 'iPhone Mirroring.' IT coordinators can set different permission levels for 'Shared Lab Macs' versus 'Teacher Presentation Macs.' ** ## Management Modes (SOP)

Using Jamf Pro's ** Restrictions ** payload, you should apply one of these three strategies based on the machine's location:

1. ** Full Disable (High Security labs) ** :

* ** Best For ** : Library open-access Macs, Computer Labs.
* ** Setting ** : Uncheck `Allow iPhone Mirroring`.
* ** Effect ** : If a student tries to pair their iPhone, they will see a message: "This feature is disabled by your organization." This prevents students from showing social media or personal photos on school monitors.

1. ** Forced View-Only (Presentation Focus) ** :

* ** Best For ** : Classroom podium Macs used by teachers.
* ** Setting ** : Enable `Force View-Only Mirroring`.
* ** Effect ** : The iPhone screen can be displayed on the Mac (perfect for demonstrating a student's mobile project), but the teacher's Mac keyboard and mouse cannot control the iPhone. This prevents accidental interaction with the student's personal notifications.

1. ** Restricted Data Transfer (DLP Focus) ** :

* ** Best For ** : Faculty/Staff administrative computers.
* ** Setting ** : Disable `Allow File and Clipboard Sync with iPhone Mirroring`.
* ** Effect ** : Personal iPhone mirroring is allowed, but the ability to drag-and-drop files between the school Mac and the personal iPhone is blocked to prevent data leakage.

## Administrative Insight:

Don't forget the ** Purple indicator ** ! macOS 26 shows a prominent purple bar in the menu bar whenever iPhone Mirroring is active. During classroom rounds, teachers can easily spot if a student is mirroring a device that shouldn't be.
