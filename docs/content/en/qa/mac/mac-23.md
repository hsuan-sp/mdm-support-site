**macOS 26 provides granular MDM controls for 'iPhone Mirroring.' IT coordinators can set different permission levels for 'Shared Lab Macs' versus 'Teacher Presentation Macs.'**

In a school environment, the primary concern is a student operating a shared Mac and mirroring their personal iPhone's social messages or inappropriate game content, disrupting the class.

## I. 2026 Management Modes (SOP)

Using Jamf Pro's **Restrictions** payload, you should apply one of these three strategies based on the machine's Smart Group:

1. **Full Disable (High Security labs)**:
   - **Best For**: Library open-access Macs, Computer Labs.
   - **Setting**: Uncheck `Allow iPhone Mirroring`.
   - **Effect**: If a student tries to pair their iPhone, they will see a message: "This feature is disabled by your organization."

2. **Forced View-Only (Presentation Focus)**:
   - **Best For**: Classroom podium Macs used by teachers for projection.
   - **Setting**: Enable `Force View-Only Mirroring`.
   - **Effect**: The iPhone screen can be displayed on the Mac (perfect for demonstrating a student's mobile project), but the teacher's Mac keyboard and mouse cannot control the iPhone.

3. **Restricted Data Transfer (DLP Focus)**:
   - **Best For**: Faculty/Staff administrative computers.
   - **Setting**: Disable `Allow File and Clipboard Sync with iPhone Mirroring`.
   - **Effect**: Personal iPhone mirroring is allowed, but the ability to drag-and-drop files between the school Mac and the personal iPhone is blocked to prevent data leakage of school records.

## II. Operational Recommendations

- **Automation Strategy**: Consider using Jamf Pro's "Time-Based" policies to switch to "View Only" during instructional hours and allow full mirroring after school.
- **Monitoring Indicators**: Remind teachers and students that when iPhone Mirroring is active, macOS 26 shows a prominent purple bar in the menu bar, making it easy for teachers to spot during classroom rounds.

**Administrator's Insight**: For M5 Macs, the mirroring latency is extremely low. We recommend using "View Only" mode as a tool for "Student Work Showcase" rather than outright blocking it, to maximize the value of teaching technology.
