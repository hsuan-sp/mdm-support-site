## Q: How should we design our macOS update strategy for 2026? How does DDM change things?

## Answer

** In the macOS 26 (Tahoe) era, Apple has fully transitioned to Declarative Device Management (DDM) for software updates. IT teams no longer "send a command" to update; they "declare a state." ** This shift solves the old problem of update commands being ignored or failing due to network timing.

## Comparison: Traditional vs. Declarative (DDM)

| Feature | Old MDM Command | New DDM (macOS 23+) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ** Logic ** | Server pushes, Device might ignore | ** Device self-monitors ** and enforces |
| ** Deadlines ** | Optional / Flaky | ** Hard Enforcement Deadlines ** |
| ** User Experience ** | Random popups | Clear countdowns and notifications |
| ** Visibility ** | "Unknown" status until done | Real-time status: "Downloading," "Ready" |

## 2026 Standard Operating Procedure for IT:

1. ** Set an Enforcement Deadline ** :

* ** Major Updates (e.g., 26.1) ** : Set a deadline for ** 14-21 days ** after release. This gives everyone time to choose a convenient moment.
* ** Security Patches (RSR) ** : Set a deadline for ** 48 hours ** . Critical security shouldn't wait.
* ** The Result ** : Users get multiple gentle reminders. If they haven't updated by the deadline, the Mac will ** force a restart and install ** automatically at the specified time.

1. ** Utilize Background Caching ** :

* Ensure each administrative or classroom building has at least one Mac mini acting as a ** "Content Caching" ** server. This ensures the update files are downloaded from the school's local network rather than hitting your external internet line 500 times simultaneously.

1. ** Blackout Dates ** :

* Use the "Update Delay" feature in Jamf Pro during ** Assessment Weeks ** or Final Exams. You don't want a student's Mac to trigger a forced restart in the middle of a high-stakes digital exam because a deadline was reached.

## Institutional Advice:

Transitioning to DDM Enforcement Deadlines is the only way to ensure 100% compliance across a laptop fleet. It moves the responsibility of "staying updated" from the student to the hardware itself.
