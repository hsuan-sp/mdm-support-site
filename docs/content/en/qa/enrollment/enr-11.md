**This is usually due to a 'System Permission Conflict' or specific 'App Management Attributes.' Check the following three areas in order:**

## 1. Distinguish between "Remove from Home Screen" and "Delete"

In recent versions of iPadOS, long-pressing an app brings up "Remove App." Upon selection, the system asks to either "Delete App" or "Remove from Home Screen." If the "Delete" option is missing, the function is locked.

## 2. Screen Time Interference

- **Local Settings Priority**: If a student has manually gone to **Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions > iTunes & App Store Purchases** and set "Deleting Apps" to "Don't Allow," this local setting will block the MDM policy.
- **Solution**: Push a new "Restrictions" profile from Jamf Pro and ensure the relevant options are checked to forcibly override local restrictions.

## 3. App-Specific Management Attributes

- **Non-Removable Apps**: When deploying an app via Jamf Pro, check its settings. If "Make app non-removable" is checked, students cannot delete that specific app even if they have global deletion permissions.
- **Solution**: Return to the App configuration in Jamf Pro and uncheck "Make app non-removable" if applicable.

## Troubleshooting Tips:

- **Sync Issues**: Sometimes devices don't refresh permissions immediately. Try sending a **Blank Push** or **Update Inventory** command.
- **System Apps**: Note that certain native Apple apps (e.g., Settings, App Store, Messages) cannot be deleted under any circumstances as part of the core system protection.
