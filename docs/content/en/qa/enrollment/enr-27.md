  Zero-Wipe MDM Migration: Moving devices from MOE Managed Jamf Pro to an
  In-House MDM.

## Q: Zero-Wipe MDM Migration: Moving devices from MOE Managed Jamf Pro to an In-House MDM.

## Answer

*  **As educational projects evolve, many schools look to migrate devices from a centrally managed instance (like Taiwan's MOE Jamf Pro) to their own in-house MDM server. Prior to iOS 26, this required a full erase, which was a barrier for students with extensive learning data. iOS 26 solves this with 'Zero-Wipe MDM Migration.'**## The Migration Workflow (SOP)

## 1. Preparation in ASM/ABM

The MDM server change must originate at the root of the ownership chain:***In**Apple School Manager**, go to**Devices**.***Select the target devices and choose**Edit MDM Server**.***Point them to your new "In-House" MDM server.**## 2. Configure the Migration Payload

In your *existing* (MOE) MDM server, you must configure the migration instructions:***Target MDM URL**: The Enrollment URL of your new server.***Enforcement Deadline**: Define the date and time when the transfer**must**occur.

## 3. The Device Experience***The student receives a notification that their device will be moved to a new management system.*****Up until the deadline, they can choose "Later."*****At the**Enforcement Deadline**, the device silently unenrolls from the MOE server and immediately enrolls in the school's server.***Crucial**: All local student files, photos, and project data are**not touched**.

## Risks and Mitigation for Schools***App Licensing**: VPP app licenses belong to the MDM server. You must ensure you have enough VPP licenses in the**new**server for all apps. We recommend setting the new server as the license owner prior to migration.***Configuration Conflicts**: If the old server had a "Restriction" that the new server doesn't, those "ghost" restrictions might linger if not handled correctly. We recommend a "Cleanup" script run by the new MDM upon first check-in.***Teacher/Staff vs. Student**: This feature is highly recommended for Teacher/Staff devices to avoid disrupting their administrative files. For student devices, if the storage is already cluttered, a traditional "Return to Service" (Wipe) remains the better option for long-term stability.
