**A 'Service Replacement' unit has a brand-new serial number. To automate the setup, you must handle the serial transfer and use Automated Device Enrollment (ADE).** Note: **Return to Service (RTS)** only applies to devices already in management and is not for unboxing new replacement units.

## Standard SOP:

## 1. Update Apple School Manager (ASM)

- **Auto-Transfer** : If repaired by an Apple Authorized Service Provider, the asset ownership often transfers to the new serial automatically.
- **Manual Assignment** : If it appears in ASM, search for the new serial and click **Edit MDM Server** to assign it to your Jamf server.
- **Release Old Unit** : Once the new unit is in service, "Release" the old, scrapped serial from ASM to keep your inventory clean.

## 2. Sync Jamf Pro

- Go to **Settings > Global Management > Device Enrollment > [Your Server]** .
- Click **Sync Now** to ensure the new serial number is pulled into your PreStage Enrollments scope.

## 3. Initial Enrollment (ADE Flow)

- Power on the device to the **Setup Assistant** .
- Manually connect to Wi-Fi (the device isn't managed yet).
- The device will fetch the **Remote Management** screen. Click "Download Profile" to begin the automated app and setting installation.

## 4. Future Resets (Using RTS)

- Once the device has completed the above steps, it is now "Managed."
- **Next time** you need to wipe it for a new student, you can use the **Return to Service (RTS)** command for a zero-touch wipe and Wi-Fi reconnect.

## Troubleshooting:

- **Serial Not Found** : If the new unit isn't in ASM, contact the repair shop and ask them to upload the "Case Number" and replacement record to Apple’s educational asset system.
- **Stuck on Activation Lock** : If the "new" machine asks for an Apple Account, contact the vendor; this is likely residue from their testing or a previous owner.
