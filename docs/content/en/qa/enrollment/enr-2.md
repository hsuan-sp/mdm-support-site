**Yes, you can, but manual enrollment (User-Initiated) provides significantly less administrative control compared to Automated Device Enrollment (ADE).**

Manual enrollment is typically reserved for personal "Bring Your Own Device" (BYOD) scenarios or donated legacy hardware that cannot be added to Apple School Manager (ASM).

## Key Differences:

1. **Management Authority**:
   - **Automated (ADE)**: Devices are placed in **"Supervised Mode"** by default. This grants the school the highest level of authority, enabling features like silent app updates, forcing restrictions (kiosk mode), and preventing the removal of the management profile.
   - **Manual**: Devices are "Unsupervised." The school has limited control and cannot force certain high-level restrictions.

2. **Removal Rights**:
   - **Automated (ADE)**: The school can make the management profile **"Non-Removable."** The student cannot delete the profile from settings.
   - **Manual**: The user can delete the management profile at any time via **Settings > General > VPN & Device Management**, instantly disconnecting the device from the school's control.

3. **Modern Methods**:
   - While old-fashioned manual enrollment required visiting a web URL in Safari, the modern approach is **"Account-Driven Enrollment."** Users simply sign in with their Managed Apple Account in Settings, and the system automatically guides them through the enrollment.

## How to Upgrade Manual Devices to "Supervised" Status:

If you have a device that wasn't bought through school channels but you want full control over it:

1. **Physical Link**: Connect the iPad to a Mac running **Apple Configurator**.
2. **Prepare**: Use the "Prepare" wizard and select **"Add to Apple School Manager."**
3. **Wipe & Bridge**: This process **will erase the device**. Once completed, the device enters a 30-day "provisional period" during which the user can still opt-out. After 30 days, the device is permanently merged into your ASM organization as a fully Supervised asset.

## Institutional Advice:

For school-owned assets, always insist on **Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)**. Manual enrollment should only be used as a temporary workaround or for personal devices joining the campus network.
