## Q: The device shows 'Invalid Profile' or is running extremely slow, even after a reset. Why?

## Answer

** 'Invalid Profile' typically indicates that the 'Trust Anchor' (the identity chain between the device and the MDM server) has been broken. ** In this state, the device appears managed but has lost its ability to communicate. Instructions and configurations cannot be delivered correctly.

## Recommended Solutions:

## Option 1: Send 'Wipe Device' (If online)

1. Log in to Jamf Pro and attempt to send a ** Wipe Device ** command.
1. If the device receives it, performing a fresh ** Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) ** after the wipe usually establishes a new, healthy trust relationship.

## Option 2: Manual Wipe and Re-enrollment (The thorough fix)

If remote commands fail:

1. ** Manual Wipe ** : On the iPad, go to ** Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPad > Erase All Content and Settings ** .

1. ** Re-enroll ** : Once back at the "Hello" screen, connect to stable Wi-Fi and re-download the "Remote Management" profile during the Setup Assistant.

## Why does a reset sometimes fail?

* ** Command Residue ** : If you don't clear pending or failed commands in Jamf Pro before re-enrolling, the device might immediately receive the same old error commands upon reconnecting, causing it to hang again.
* ** Hardware Limitations ** : Older hardware combined with bloated configuration profiles or heavy apps can lead to severe lag.
* ** Actionable Advice ** : Always click "Cancel Pending/Failed Commands" for that serial number in Jamf Pro before the device re-enrolls.
