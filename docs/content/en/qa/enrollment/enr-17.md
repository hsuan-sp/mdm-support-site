## Q: The device is locked by 'Activation Lock'. How do I unlock it?

## Answer

**Activation Lock is an Apple security feature. If you have ownership of the device, there are several technical pathways to unlock it.** When an iPad is erased, if it previously had "Find My" enabled, it will request the original Apple Account login. As a school administrator, your options are:

## Option 1: Use an Activation Lock Bypass Code (Fastest)

If the device was Supervised and managed by Jamf Pro before being locked:

1. Log in to Jamf Pro and find the device record.
1. Under **Inventory > Security** , look for the **Activation Lock Bypass Code** .
1. Enter this code in the password field on the iPad (leave the Apple ID field blank) to skip verification.

## Option 2: Remove via Apple School Manager (The New Standard)

1. Log in to [Apple School Manager (ASM)](https://school.apple.com).
1. Click **Devices** and search for the serial number.
1. If the device belongs to your organization, click **Turn off Activation Lock** .
1. Wait a few moments, then restart the iPad to enter the setup screen normally.

## Option 3: Restore using a Computer

If the device is in an abnormal state and cannot receive commands:

1. Use **Finder / Apple Configurator** (macOS) or the **Apple Devices app** (Windows).
1. Enter Recovery Mode and perform a Restore.

1. **Note** : This clears the data, but the Activation Lock screen may still appear (requiring Option 1 or 2 to unlock).

## Option 4: Contact Apple Support

If automated tools fail (e.g., a device was not enrolled before being locked by a student), prepare the original purchase invoice or packing slip and contact **Apple Support** to open a case for manual removal.

## Practical Advice:

In your Jamf Pro **PreStage Enrollment** settings, always check **Prevent Activation Lock** . This ensures devices do not enter a locked state when erased, reducing administrative overhead.
