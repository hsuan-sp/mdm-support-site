**If your iPad goes straight to the standard personal setup screens instead of the school's "Remote Management" prompt, it usually means the device serial number hasn't been linked to your MDM server by Apple.**

This automated process—known as **Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)**—relies on the device "checking in" with Apple's servers the moment it connects to Wi-Fi. If no assignment is found, Apple treats it as a private retail device.

## Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Verify Status in Apple School Manager (ASM)**:
   - Log in to [school.apple.com](https://school.apple.com).
   - Search for the serial number under **"Devices."**
   - Check the **"MDM Server"** field. If it’s blank, you need to manually assign it to your Jamf Pro server.

2. **Check with your Reseller**:
   - If the serial number is not found in ASM at all, your authorized Apple reseller hasn't uploaded the purchase record yet. Large orders during the back-to-school season can occasionally cause a delay of a few business days. Contact your vendor with the Purchase Order (PO) number to expedite the sync.

3. **Audit Jamf Pro PreStage Scope**:
   - Ensure the device is included in the **"Scope"** of your active PreStage Enrollment profile in Jamf Pro. We recommend setting your primary PreStage as the **"Default"** so new assignments are captured automatically.

4. **Network Requirements**:
   - The device must be on a Wi-Fi network that allows traffic to Apple’s activation servers (and doesn't block APNs) to trigger the setup.

## How to Relink the Device:

If the device has already reached the Home Screen (skipping management):

- **The device must be erased**: Go to **Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPad > Erase All Content and Settings**.
- Once wiped and restarted, ensure the Wi-Fi connection is stable. The device will check again and should now present the "Remote Management" screen.
