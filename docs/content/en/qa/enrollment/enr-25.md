## Q: Which Setup Assistant steps should I skip during PreStage Enrollment? What are the best practices for schools?

## Answer

** PreStage Enrollment allows you to suppress multiple steps during the initial device setup. For educational settings, we recommend skipping most non-essential steps to accelerate deployment and prevent students from misconfiguring the device. ** ## Recommended Steps to SKIP (Education)

## Privacy and Location

* ** ✅ Location Services ** : Skip. IT should enable this globally to support "Find My" and time zone accuracy.
* ** ✅ App Analytics ** : Skip. The organization makes this decision on behalf of the fleet.
* ** ✅ Screen Time ** : Skip. This is a consumer-level parental control. Use MDM restrictions for fleet-wide management instead.

## Apple Services

* ** ✅ Apple Pay ** : Skip. Students typically do not have credit cards for school devices.
* ** ✅ Siri / New Feature Highlighting ** : Skip. This accelerates the "Hello" to "Home Screen" transition.
* ** ✅ Apple Intelligence (iOS 26) ** : Skip. You can enable or manage these AI features later via MDM.
* ** ✅ iMessage & FaceTime ** : Skip. Prevents students from signing into personal messaging services during setup.

## UI and Appearance

* ** ✅ True Tone ** : Skip. Non-essential for classroom use.
* ** ✅ Display Zoom ** : Skip. Use the system default.
* ** ✅ Appearance (Light/Dark) ** : Skip. Standardize on the system default for a uniform look.
* ** ✅ Liquid Glass (iOS 26) ** : Skip. Standardizes the UI across the fleet.

## Other

* ** ✅ Terms and Conditions ** : Skip. IT accepts these on behalf of the organization in ASM.
* ** ✅ Diagnostics ** : Skip for privacy and speed.

## Items you should NOT skip (or should keep)

* ** ❌ Remote Management ** : ** Cannot be skipped ** . This is the core Step of ADE that informs the user the device is managed by the school.
* ** ⚠️ Biometrics (Touch ID / Face ID) ** :
* ** Elementary ** : Skip. Prevents confusion for young students.
* ** Middle/High School ** : Keep. Enhances local security and convenience.
* ** Staff ** : Keep.
* ** ⚠️ Apple Account Login ** :
* ** Shared iPad ** : Skip. Managed via the MDM login screen.
* ** 11:1 iPad ** : Keep or Skip depending on whether students are expected to use Managed Apple Accounts.

## Practical Benefits of a Lean PreStage

* ** Efficiency ** : A full Setup Assistant takes 10–15 minutes. An optimized PreStage takes ** under 2 minutes ** .
* ** Support ** : Prevents students from getting stuck on "Siri can't hear me" or confusion over Apple Pay prompts.
* ** Uniformity ** : Ensures every device in the classroom looks and behaves exactly the same.
