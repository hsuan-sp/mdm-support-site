**Supervised Mode is a special state that gives the school "Institutional Ownership" over the device's operating system.**

A standard iPad bought from a store is "Unsupervised" (private). A school-owned device, however, should always be in Supervised Mode—enabled through **ADE** or **Apple Configurator**—to ensure a safe and focused learning environment.

## Critical Differences:

| Feature                     | Unsupervised (Personal) | Supervised (School)                  |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **MDM Profile Removal**     | User can delete anytime | **Can be made permanent**            |
| **Kiosk Mode (Single App)** | Not supported           | **Supported (Lock to one activity)** |
| **Global Network Proxy**    | Not supported           | **Supported (Filter web content)**   |
| **AirDrop Control**         | User choice             | **Can be forced Off by school**      |
| **Activation Lock Bypass**  | Impossible for IT       | **Managed by the school**            |
| **Silent Updates**          | Requires user consent   | **IT can force OS & App updates**    |

## How to Check the Status:

Open **Settings** on the iPad. Look at the very top, just below the user’s name. You should see a line of text:

> _This iPad is supervised and managed by [Your School Name]._

## Institutional Advice:

If a school iPad is not Supervised, students can easily bypass web filters, delete management profiles, or factory reset the device. Supervised Mode is the first line of defense in maintaining campus digital standards.
