## Q: What is 'Zero-Wipe MDM Migration'? Is this new iOS 26 feature suitable for schools?

## Answer

** iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 support 'Zero-Wipe MDM Migration,' allowing for the change of MDM systems without resetting the device. While impressive, we recommend schools prioritize 'Return to Service' to ensure devices remain clean and stable. ** ## How it Works

1. Configure the target (new) MDM in ** Apple School Manager (ASM) ** .
1. Set an ** Enrollment Deadline ** .
1. The device notifies the user as the deadline approaches.
1. At the deadline, the device automatically:

* Removes the old MDM management profile.
* ** Preserves ** user data, apps, and settings.
* Registry automatically with the new MDM.

## Use Cases

* Changing MDM vendors (e.g., migrating from a legacy system to Jamf Pro).
* Regional education bureaus merging multiple MDM instances into one.

## Considerations for Education

## Potential Challenges:

1. ** Configuration Residue ** :

* Certain settings from the old MDM (certificates, Wi-Fi profiles) may not clear perfectly.
* Conflicts between old and new policies could occur, potentially breaking features like Apple Classroom or AirPlay.

1. ** App License Management ** :

* VPP App licenses must be re-assigned between the old and new MDMs.
* If handled poorly, apps may fail to update or require re-installation, increasing IT overhead.

1. ** Shared iPad Environments ** :

* Preserving data means residual caches from previous users remain on the device. If you need a "Clean" device for the next user, this feature is not ideal.

1. ** System Bloat ** :

* Long-term technical debt and system caches are preserved. This can impact the efficiency of new MDM commands.

## Recommended Alternative: Return to Service (RTS)

For student devices that require periodic resets, ** Return to Service ** remains the gold standard.

* ** Total Wipe ** : Ensures the device starts from a 100% clean state.
* ** Wi-Fi Persistence ** : Reconnects to Wi-Fi automatically after the wipe.
* ** Auto-Enrollment ** : Automatically completes the ADE flow.
* ** App Preservation (iOS 26+) ** : You can now choose to preserve the Managed App binaries, saving significant redownload time while still clearing user data.

## When to use Zero-Wipe Migration:

* ** 1-to-1 Teacher/Staff Devices ** : Avoids forcing administrative staff to re-configure their personal data and settings.
* ** BYOD Programs ** : Transitions management on teacher-owned devices without touching their personal photos or files.

## When NOT to use it:

* Shared iPads or iPad trolleys.
* Student devices that require a seasonal "Fresh Start."
* Devices exhibiting buggy or abnormal behavior.
