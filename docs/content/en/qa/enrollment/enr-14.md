## Q: How do I make an iPad automatically connect to Wi-Fi and re-enroll after a reset? (Return to Service)

## Answer

*  **'Return to Service' is a command feature introduced by Apple in iOS 17. It allows a device to automatically bypass the initial setup screens, connect to Wi-Fi, and re-enroll after a remote wipe.**This feature eliminates the need for technicians to manually select language, region, and Wi-Fi settings after a device is cleared.

## How it Works:

When an administrator sends the "Wipe Device" command from Jamf Pro, they can include a**Wi-Fi Profile**as part of the instruction. After the device clears all data and reboots, it automatically applies the Wi-Fi credentials to get online and immediately requests**Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)**from Apple's servers.

## Prerequisites:***Hardware**: iPad must be running iPadOS 17 or later.***Management Status**: The device must be already enrolled via ADE and in a**Supervised**state.***Configuration**: A corresponding PreStage Enrollment must be configured in Jamf Pro with the appropriate Wi-Fi settings.

## Recommended Steps:

1. Search for and select the target device in Jamf Pro.
2. Click**Management > Send Remote Commands > Wipe Device**.
3. In the command options, check**Return to Service**.
4. Specify the Wi-Fi configuration to be sent to the device.
5. If Activation Lock might be present, ensure**Clear Activation Lock**is also checked.
6. Send the command.

## Risks and Limitations:***Network Dependency**: If the specified Wi-Fi SSID changes or the password is incorrect, the device will be stuck at the "Hello" screen, requiring manual intervention to solve the connectivity issue.***Processing Time**: It typically takes 5 to 10 minutes from sending the command to the device returning to the Home Screen, depending on network speed and the size of the configurations/apps being downloaded.***Data Erasure**: This feature still performs a full device wipe. Always ensure any critical instructional data has been backed up to the cloud before execution.
