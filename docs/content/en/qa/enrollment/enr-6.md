## Q: The setup is stuck spinning on 'Retrieving remote management configuration'. How do I troubleshoot?

## Answer

*  **This indicates a communication delay or interruption while the device attempts to fetch the MDM configuration profile from Apple's servers.*****It is usually related to the network environment or MDM server response.**"Retrieving remote management configuration" is a key step in**Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)**.
Ideally, it should complete within 30 seconds to 2 minutes. If it hangs for more than 5 minutes, proceed with the following checks:***Cause 1: Network Restrictions*****Firewall Blocking**: The school network might be blocking access to Apple's device management hosts.***Ensure traffic to `iprofiles.apple.com` and your MDM server URL is allowed.*****Solution**: Try connecting the iPad to a mobile hotspot (4G/5G). If it proceeds successfully, the issue lies with the campus firewall.***Cause 2: Jamf Pro Performance or Settings*****Server Latency**: If hundreds of devices are enrolling simultaneously, Jamf Cloud might experience queuing delays.***Corrupt PreStage**: Occasionally, a PreStage configuration can have logic errors.***Try re-saving the PreStage setting in Jamf Pro to force a refresh.*****Cause 3: Time Desynchronization*****If the device's clock deviates significantly from standard time out-of-the-box, the SSL secure connection will fail.*****Usually, restarting the device and connecting to a stable Wi-Fi network will automatically correct the time.*****Remedial Action**:

Force restart the device (hold the Power button/Home button combo). The device will restart the Setup Assistant, and the second attempt often succeeds.
