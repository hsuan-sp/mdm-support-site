## Q: Why does the device get stuck on 'Installing Apps' during PreStage Enrollment/Setup Assistant?

## Answer

* **When you configure 'Install Apps' in PreStage Enrollment, the device waits for apps to download before allowing access to the Home Screen.**
* **Any network issues or VPP license failures will cause a deadlock.**

This is extremely common during**Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)**.
Admins often want students to see essential apps immediately upon boot, but if the environment isn't perfect, it leads to disaster during mass deployments.

* **Core Causes**:

1. **Insufficient VPP Licenses or Invalid Token**:

* **If the assigned app has 0 remaining licenses, Apple servers cannot issue a download token, causing the device to wait indefinitely.**
* **Solution**: Check the "Volume Purchasing" status in Jamf Pro to ensure sufficient licenses.

1. **Campus Wi-Fi Saturation**:

* **If a class of 30 iPads tries to download a 2GB app (e.g., GarageBand) at the Setup screen simultaneously, the Wi-Fi bandwidth will collapse, leading to timeouts.**
* **Solution**: Avoid forcing large apps during PreStage. Let students reach the Home Screen first, then allow apps to download in the background.

1. **Declarative Device Management (DDM) State Changes**:

* **In modern architectures, app deployment is handled by**DDM**.
* **If your**Service Access**terms haven't been accepted in ASM, DDM may fail to trigger the silent download from the App Store.

1. **Configuration Error: Mandatory Install**:

* **In Jamf Pro's PreStage settings, if an app is marked as "Required" and cannot be skipped, the student cannot click "Continue" until the download finishes.**

* **Best Practices**:

* **Minimize Initial Payload**: PreStage should only enforce critical configuration profiles or extremely small "Guide Apps".
* **Background Install**: Set main educational apps to deploy **after** Enrollment is complete, rather than intercepting the user during the Setup Assistant.
* **Pilot Test**: Before unboxing remotely, take one device through the full process to verify VPP sync and download speeds.
