## Q: Students are reporting the screen looks 'Blurry' (Liquid Glass Design). How do I handle this?

## Answer

*  **This is usually not a hardware failure! The 'Liquid Glass' design language introduced in iOS 26 uses heavy 'Frosted Glass' and 'Depth of Field' effects that can be mistaken for a foggy or defective screen.**## How to tell if it's a design effect:

1. **The Screenshot Test**:***Have the student take a screenshot (Power + Volume Up).*****View the screenshot in the Photos app.*****If the image is sharp but the screen physically looks blurry ➡ ️**Hardware failure (NAND/Panel)**.***If the image inside the screenshot is blurry (e.g., the Lock Screen background) ➡ ️**Software effect**.

1. **Check Liquid Glass Settings**:***Go to**Settings > Display & Brightness > Appearance**.***Check the**Liquid Glass Transparency**slider. If set high, backgrounds will be extremely blurred.

## How to Resolve:***Case A: Software Intent (Normal)*****Explain to the student that this is the new iOS 26 style (similar to visionOS).*****If it impacts readability, go to**Accessibility > Display & Text Size**and turn on**Reduce Transparency**. This disables the Liquid Glass effect and returns to solid backgrounds.***Case B: Hardware Failure*****If the screenshot is sharp but the physical view is blurry, and a restart doesn't fix it, the screen coating may be delaminating or the panel may be failing. Report for repair!**## Defensive Management:

When upgrading to**iOS 26**, spend 2 minutes during homeroom explaining that "Looking a bit blurry on the Lock Screen is the new style." This will prevent a flood of false repair reports.
