**iOS 26 finally solves the Bluetooth headset nightmare for Shared iPads! A new 'Audio Accessory Configuration' allows for 'Ephemeral Pairing' that doesn't sync to iCloud, perfectly solving the chaos in shared environments.**

## The Old Problem (Prior to v26):

When Student A paired their personal AirPods to a Shared iPad:

1. The pairing record was written to their "Managed Apple Account."

2. When Student B logged in later, the iPad might try to automatically connect to Student A's AirPods in the next classroom due to residual Bluetooth cache.
3. Or Student A goes home and finds their headphones keep trying to reconnect to the school iPad.

## The iOS 26 Solution: Ephemeral Pairing

MDM can now push the `com.apple.configuration.audio-accessory.settings` payload:

- **Function**: Allows pairing of AirPods/Beats but **blocks** writing that data to the iCloud Keychain.

- **Result**:
  - Once the student **Logs out**, the iPad immediately "forgets" the headset.
  - The headset doesn't "remember" the iPad as its primary owner.
  - Every use session is treated as a clean, one-time connection.

## Configuration Advice:

- If your school provides headsets for language labs or allows students to bring their own Bluetooth buds, **enable this setting immediately**.
- It will drastically reduce "Teacher, I'm hearing someone else's music!" support tickets.

## Note:

This feature requires compatible headset firmware and iPadOS 26. We recommend testing one pair to confirm the "auto-disconnect on logout" behavior before full deployment.
