## Q: How do I restrict USB/Thunderbolt drive access on macOS to prevent data leaks?

## Answer

** Starting with macOS 15, Apple introduced a new 'Media Management' framework that allows for granular control over external storage devices. macOS 26 (Tahoe) further strengthens this security. ** Controlled USB access is vital in computer labs or administrative offices to prevent unauthorized file copying or malware injection.

## Technical Context: The Intel Mac Sunset

* ** Final Support ** : macOS 26 is the ** last supported version ** for Intel-based Macs.
* ** Eligible Intel Models ** : Only 2019/2020 Pro/iMac models can run OS 26.
* ** Strategy ** : Plan for Apple Silicon upgrades. Intel Macs on OS 26 will receive security patches until 2028.

## Implementation Strategies in Jamf Pro:

1. ** Read-Only Mode ** : Set external drives to read-only. Students can read teaching materials from a flash drive but ** cannot copy files out ** of the computer.

1. ** Full Block ** : For high-security administrative Macs, you can disable the mounting of external storage devices entirely.

1. ** Thunderbolt Accessory Security ** : On Apple Silicon (M-series) Macs, you can require "User Approval" or "Admin Authorization" for new Thunderbolt accessories to prevent malicious peripheral attacks via the port.
