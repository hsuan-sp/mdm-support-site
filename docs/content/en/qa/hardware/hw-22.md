**The iPad 9 (released in 2021), a staple of the Digital Initiative, is now entering its 4th or 5th year of service as of 2026. While it still supports iOS 26, schools are beginning to face hardware aging and performance bottlenecks.**

## Fleet Evaluation Standards for 2026:

### 1. Performance vs. Modern Apps

- **Advantage**: iOS 26 still supports iPad 9, meaning security updates and MDM commands work.
- **Disadvantage**: The A13 chip with 3GB RAM causes noticeable lag when multitasking or using modern AI "Writing Tools."

### 2. Battery & Physical Health

- **Battery Aging**: Most units are expected to be under 80% capacity, failing to last a full school day.
- **Storage**: 64GB is often insufficient for modern teaching apps and student projects.

## Renewal vs. Replacement Indicators:

### Suitable for Continued Use:

- **Single-Purpose**: E-reader, simple quizzes, or listening exercises.
- **Kiosk**: Fixed library search station or attendance scanner.

### Recommended for Replacement:

- **Creative Classes**: A13 struggles with 4K video export or complex layers.
- **AR/AI Labs**: Cannot run latest AI models or advanced AR tracking.
- **All-Day Usage**: Battery life is insufficient.

## Transition Strategy (The 2026 Shift):

1. **Tier 2 Redeployment**: Move aging iPad 9 units to "light duty" carts for reading or testing only.
2. **Batttery Repair Project**: Before the contract ends in 2026, identify units with critical battery failure for warranty repair.
3. **Phased Replacement**: Procure new M-series iPads (8GB RAM+) as the primary devices for "Creation and Exploration" classes.

## IT Advice:

Use Jamf Pro to generate health reports. If an iPad 9 takes 3x longer to boot an app compared to a new model, flag it for priority replacement.
