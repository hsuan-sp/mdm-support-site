**The iPad 9 (released in 2021), a staple of the Digital Initiative, is now entering its 4th or 5th year of service as of 2026. While it still supports iOS 26, schools are beginning to face hardware aging and performance bottlenecks.**

## Fleet Evaluation Standards:

1. **Performance vs. Modern Apps** :

- As apps integrate more AI and complex multitasking features, the A13 chip in the iPad 9 is showing its age. If teachers report significant lag during multi-app usage or when using AI "Writing Tools," the device is reaching its functional limit.

1. **Battery & Physical Health** :

- After four years of cycles, many units will struggle to last a full 6-hour school day. Any signs of **Battery Swelling** (screen lifting) should be treated as a safety priority for immediate decommissioning.

1. **The 'A17 Pro' Gap** :

- Newer entry-level iPads (like the iPad mini 7 or updated iPad 10/11) feature Neural Engine hardware that the iPad 9 lacks. If your curriculum begins to rely heavily on "Apple Intelligence" or "Image Playground," the iPad 9 fleet will be left behind in functionality.

## Transition Strategy (The 2026 Shift):

- **Rotation** : Move aging iPad 9 units to lower-intensity environments, such as administrative check-in kiosks or as designated "e-reader" units in the library.
- **Replacement Cycle** : Focus new procurement on **M-series iPads (Air/Pro)** or **A17 Pro (mini)** to ensure a 5-year future-proof window.
- **Trade-in** : Check if local vendors provide trade-in programs for educational fleets to subsidize the cost of new M4/M5 hardware.

## IT Advice:

Don't wait for the whole fleet to fail at once. Start identifying the "Top 20% most worn" units in mid-2026 and request budget for a rolling replacement to ensure instructional continuity isn't interrupted by a wave of hardware failures in late 2027.
