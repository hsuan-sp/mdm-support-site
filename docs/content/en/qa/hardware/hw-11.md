**For base models like the iPad 9 and the later iPad 11 (A16), technical limitations prevent "Battery Maximum Capacity (%)" from being displayed directly in System Settings or the Jamf Pro console.** However, newer models released in 2024 (such as the M4 iPad Pro and M2/M3 iPad Air) now include a comprehensive Battery Health menu similar to the iPhone.

## 1. Check "Battery Usage History" (Most Reliable Indicator):

1. Go to **Settings > Battery**.
2. View the Last 24 Hours or Last 10 Days chart.
3. **Observe the Slope**: If the battery percentage curve shows a "cliff dive" or drops more than 20% in a short time while performing simple tasks (like browsing), significant chemical aging has occurred.
4. **Unexpected Shutdowns**: If the device shuts down suddenly while still showing 10-20% charge, this is a classic sign of battery failure.

## 2. Check Performance Throttling:

Go to **Settings > Battery > Battery Health & Charging**.

- **New Models (M4/M2)**: Displays "Maximum Capacity" and "Cycle Count" directly.

- **Older Models (iPad 9)**: If you see a message saying "This iPad has experienced an unexpected shutdown...", the system is actively throttling the CPU to prevent crashes due to a weak battery.

## 3. Use Jamf Pro's "Last Battery Level" Tracking:

In your Jamf Pro inventory, add the "Battery Level" column.

- **Method**: If a batch of devices finishes a charging cycle (should be 100%) but consistently reports less than 60% after just one class period, create a Smart Group to flag these units for inspection.

## 4. Advanced Management for 2024+ Models:

For the latest iPads, administrators can use a Restrictions Profile to enable the **"80% Charge Limit."** This is critical for devices stored in charging carts for long periods, as it significantly extends battery lifespan.

## Practical Advice:

Lithium batteries typically show noticeable degradation after **800-1,000 charge cycles**. For project devices that have been in use for three years, if battery life is severely impacting teaching, prepare for a repair or battery replacement service.
