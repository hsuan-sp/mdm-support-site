## Q: How do I check iPad battery health? Why can't I see this data in the MDM console?

## Answer

*  **For base models like the iPad 9 and the later iPad 11 (A16), technical limitations prevent "Battery Maximum Capacity (%)" from being displayed directly in System Settings or the Jamf Pro console.**However, newer models released in 2024 (such as the M4 iPad Pro and M2/M3 iPad Air) now include a comprehensive Battery Health menu similar to the iPhone.

## For older models (iPad 9, etc.):

1. **MDM Inventory**: While you cannot see the percentage, Jamf Pro can report**Battery Cycle Count**and**Current Battery Level**. A standard iPad battery is designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity at 1,000 complete charge cycles.
2. **Diagnostic Tools**: If a device shows significant lag or sudden shutdowns, contact an Apple Authorized Service Provider (AASP). They can run remote or local diagnostics to verify the precise health of the battery.

## For 2024 Models and Later:

Devices like the M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air have a native menu under**Settings > Battery > Battery Health**, which displays:***Maximum Capacity percentage.*****Cycle Count.*****Manufacture and First Use dates.**## Practical Advice:

If a batch of student iPads shows consistent performance issues after 3-4 years of heavy use, use Jamf Pro to export a report of**Cycle Counts**. Any device exceeding 800-1,000 cycles should be prioritized for hardware inspection or battery replacement.
