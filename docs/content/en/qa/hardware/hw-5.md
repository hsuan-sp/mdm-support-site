## Q: How should we store iPads during the summer break to prevent battery damage?

## Answer

*  **To protect the long-term health of your iPad's lithium-ion battery during extended breaks, you should follow the "50% Power + Full Shutdown" rule.**Storing a device improperly for 2-3 months can lead to "Deep Discharge," where the battery becomes chemically unable to hold a charge ever again.

## The Three Golden Rules for Storage:

1. **Charge to ~50%**:***Do not store at 0%**: This can lead to the battery falling into a deep discharge state, making the device impossible to turn on come September.***Do not store at 100%**: Keeping a battery at maximum capacity for months can cause it to lose some of its total lifespan permanently.

1. **Power Off Completely**:***After reaching 50%, go to**Settings > General > Shut Down**. This ensures the device isn't slowly draining power while sitting in the cart.

1. **Cool, Dry Environment**:***Store the iPads (and the charging cart) in a temperature-controlled room. Excessive heat (like a non-air-conditioned classroom in the height of summer) accelerated chemical degradation.**## Operational Advice for IT:

Before the final day of the term, send a message to all students/teachers asking them to leave their devices at ~50% charge before handing them in. When you move the devices to storage, verify they are fully powered off to ensure a smooth "Back to School" experience with minimal "dead" hardware.
