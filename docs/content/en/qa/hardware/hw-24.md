## Q: Managing Wi-Fi 6, 6E, and 7: How to plan school network upgrades for a mixed fleet.

## Answer

*  **With the introduction of M4/M5 iPads and Macs, school networks are now 'Tri-generational.' Handling Wi-Fi 6, 6E, and 7 simultaneously requires careful planning to prevent newer devices from being throttled while ensuring older iPads (like the iPad 9) remain connected.**## Key Technical Differences:***Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)**: Operates on 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. Good for density but prone to interference. (Standard for iPad 9).***Wi-Fi 6E**: Opens the**6 GHz**band. Zero interference and massive 160 MHz channels. (Standard for M2/M4 Pro).***Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be)**: Introduces**MLO (Multi-Link Operation)**, allowing the M5 Mac or iPad to connect to multiple bands (5 GHz and 6 GHz) simultaneously for extreme stability and speed.

## Upgrade Planning Strategy:

1. **WPA 3 Integration**:***Wi-Fi 6E and 7**require**WPA 3. If your school is still on WPA 2-only, your newest M-series devices will not see the 6 GHz band. You must enable**WPA 3 Personal/Enterprise**or a Transition Mode.

1. **Backhaul Bottleneck**:***A single Wi-Fi 7 AP can exceed 10 Gbps. If your school's switches are still 1 Gbps (Gigabit), the Wi-Fi 7 upgrade is a waste of money. Ensure your infrastructure supports**2.5 Gbps or 5 Gbps (mGig)**.

1. **SSID Optimization**:***Keep your legacy iPad 9s on a dedicated 2.4/5 GHz SSID.*****Create a "High Speed" 5/6 GHz SSID specifically for your M-series fleet to leverage the 6 GHz band without legacy overhead.**## Expert Advice:

If you are buying new APs in 2026,**do not buy Wi-Fi 6**. Go straight to**Wi-Fi 7**. Wi-Fi 7 is inherently more stable in dense classrooms because it can "punctuate" around interference, ensuring that even if a student's microwave or a nearby neighbor's router is on the same channel, the educational traffic still gets through.
