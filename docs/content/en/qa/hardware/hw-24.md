**With the introduction of M4/M5 iPads and Macs, school networks are now 'Tri-generational.' Handling Wi-Fi 6, 6E, and 7 simultaneously requires careful planning to prevent newer devices from being throttled while ensuring older iPads (like the iPad 9) remain connected.**

## Key Technical Differences:

- **Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)** : Operates on 2.4GHz and 5GHz. Good for density but prone to interference. (Standard for iPad 9).
- **Wi-Fi 6E** : Opens the **6GHz** band. Zero interference and massive 160MHz channels. (Standard for M2/M4 Pro).
- **Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be)** : Introduces **MLO (Multi-Link Operation)** , allowing the M5 Mac or iPad to connect to multiple bands (5GHz and 6GHz) simultaneously for extreme stability and speed.

## Upgrade Planning Strategy:

1. **WPA3 Integration** :

- Wi-Fi 6E and 7 **require** WPA3. If your school is still on WPA2-only, your newest M-series devices will not see the 6GHz band. You must enable **WPA3 Personal/Enterprise** or a Transition Mode.

1. **Backhaul Bottleneck** :

- A single Wi-Fi 7 AP can exceed 10Gbps. If your school's switches are still 1Gbps (Gigabit), the Wi-Fi 7 upgrade is a waste of money. Ensure your infrastructure supports **2.5Gbps or 5Gbps (mGig)** .

1. **SSID Optimization** :

- Keep your legacy iPad 9s on a dedicated 2.4/5GHz SSID.
- Create a "High Speed" 5/6GHz SSID specifically for your M-series fleet to leverage the 6GHz band without legacy overhead.

## Expert Advice:

If you are buying new APs in 2026, **do not buy Wi-Fi 6** . Go straight to **Wi-Fi 7** . Wi-Fi 7 is inherently more stable in dense classrooms because it can "punctuate" around interference, ensuring that even if a student's microwave or a nearby neighbor's router is on the same channel, the educational traffic still gets through.
