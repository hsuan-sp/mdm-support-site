## Q: The screen is cracked or the touch response is failing. How is warranty vs. accidental damage determined?

## Answer

*  **Apple hardware inspections follow the "Visual Mechanical Inspection (VMI)" standard to determine if a repair is covered by the limited warranty or considered out-of-warranty accidental damage.**## How Damage is Classified:

| Symptom | Classification | Diagnostic Standard |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|**Single Hairline Crack**|**Warranty**| A single, thin crack with**no visible impact point**. This is often treated as a manufacturer’s defect in the glass stress. |
|**Spiderweb/Multiple Cracks**|**Accidental Damage**| Multiple cracks originating from a central impact point. This is considered user-inflicted damage. |
|**Enclosure Bending**|**Accidental Damage**| If the iPad frame is warped or dented, it is considered out-of-warranty damage, even if the screen is intact. |
|**Black Ink Spots (LCD)**|**Accidental Damage**| Localized pressure has "leaked" the liquid crystal inside. This is almost always caused by heavy items being placed on the screen. |
|**Touch Failure (No Damage)**|**Warranty**| If the device is physically perfect but doesn't respond to touch, it is usually replaced as a hardware defect. |

## Institutional Repair Options:***Official Repair (Replacement)**: Apple typically replaces the entire unit rather than repairing the screen. This ensures the device maintains its security and water-resistance standards.***Third-Party Repairs**: While cheaper, using non-authorized repair shops**voids the remaining original warranty**and may cause compatibility issues with MDM commands later.***Disabling Activation Lock**: Before sending any device for repair, IT must send the**"Disable Activation Lock"**command via Jamf Pro. Apple cannot service a device that is locked to a user's account.

## Institutional Advice:

We recommend that schools maintain an "Internal Insurance Fund" or accidental damage protection (like AppleCare+++++++++++++ for Schools) to cover the high cost of screen replacements, which can often be up to 60-80% of the cost of a new device.
