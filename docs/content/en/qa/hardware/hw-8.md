## Q: Can I clean the iPad screen with alcohol? Is there a risk of damage?

## Answer

** Yes, Apple explicitly allows the use of specific alcohol concentrations to clean iPads. According to the latest official guidelines, you can use 70% Isopropyl Alcohol, 75% Ethyl Alcohol, or disinfectant wipes on the hard, non-porous surfaces of the device. ** In a classroom environment with multiple users, a proper disinfection routine is essential. Here is the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) based on Apple's recommendations:

## 1. Approved Cleaning Agents:

* ** 70% Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) wipes. ***** 75% Ethyl Alcohol wipes. ***** Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. ***** A soft, lint-free microfiber cloth dampened with water ** (for basic cleaning only).

## 2. Prohibited Substances & Tools:

* ❌ ** Bleach ** or products containing ** Hydrogen Peroxide ** .
* ❌ ** Window cleaners or household detergents ** .
* ❌ ** Aerosols, solvents, or abrasives ** .
* ❌ ** Compressed air ** sprayed directly into openings (can damage microphone or speaker membranes).
* ❌ ** Rough fabrics, paper towels, or napkins ** (may cause micro-scratches).

## 3. Standard Cleaning Steps:

1. ** Power Down ** : Unplug all external power, accessories, and cables, and turn off the iPad.

1. ** Spray the Cloth ** : ** Never spray cleaners directly onto the iPad. ** Spray the alcohol onto a soft, lint-free microfiber cloth until it is "slightly damp."

1. ** Wipe Gently ** : Avoid excessive wiping, which may cause damage. Avoid any openings (such as the charging port, speakers, or microphone holes) to prevent liquid from entering the interior.

1. ** Accessory Cleaning ** : The body of an Apple Pencil (USB-C) can be wiped with a dampened cloth, but ** do not wipe the tip itself or allow liquid to enter the USB-C connector. ** ## 4. Risk Warnings and Material Differences:

* ** Oleophobic Coating ** : iPad screens have an oil-resistant coating that naturally wears over time. While alcohol is allowed, frequent or excessive cleaning will accelerate the degradation of this coating.
* ** Nano-texture Models (Special Note) ** : If your iPad Pro (M4) is equipped with ** Nano-texture glass ** , only use the dedicated polishing cloth provided by Apple. For stubborn grime, you may dampen the cloth with 70% IPA.
* ** Leather and Fabric Accessories ** : ** Stay away ** from alcohol on official Apple leather, FineWoven, or Smart Folio fabrics, as it will cause discoloration or material damage.

## Practical Advice:

For school-wide management, we recommend placing a dedicated microfiber cloth in each charging cart and having teachers manage the alcohol spray to ensure students don't spray liquid directly into the devices, which could cause internal hardware damage (liquid damage is not covered under Apple's standard warranty).
