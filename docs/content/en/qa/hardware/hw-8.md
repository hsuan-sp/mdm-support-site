## Q: How to properly clean and disinfect school iPad devices?

## Answer

In a school environment, iPads are often shared between multiple students. Regular cleaning and disinfection are critical for public health. However, using incorrect cleaning methods can damage the oleophobic coating or seep into openings, leading to hardware failure.

### 1. Recommended Cleaning Methods

* Use a **70% Isopropyl Alcohol** wipe, **75% Ethyl Alcohol** wipe, or **Clorox Disinfecting Wipes**.
* Gently wipe the hard, nonporous surfaces of the iPad, such as the display, buttons, and enclosure.
* Turn off the device and unplug all power sources before cleaning.

### 2. Prohibited Substances & Tools

* **❌ Bleach** or products containing **Hydrogen Peroxide**.
* **❌ Window cleaners or household detergents**.
* **❌ Aerosols, solvents, or abrasives**.
* **❌ Compressed air** sprayed directly into openings (can damage microphone or speaker membranes).
* **❌ Rough fabrics, paper towels, or napkins** (may cause micro-scratches).

### 3. Core Principles

* **✅ Use Soft Cloths**: Use a soft, lint-free cloth (e.g., lens cloth or microfiber cloth).
* **✅ Avoid Moisture**: Do not let moisture get into any openings (like the charging port, speakers, or microphone).
* **✅ No Submerging**: Never submerge the iPad in any cleaning agents.

### 💡 Pro Tip for ICT Staff:
For devices deployed under major education projects, we recommend providing standardized "Alcohol Wipes" next to the charging carts. Remind students: **Wash hands first, then use the device**. This significantly reduces the maintenance burden!
