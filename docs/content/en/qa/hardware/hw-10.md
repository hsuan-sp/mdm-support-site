**Apple Pencil issues can usually be solved by re-pairing, tightening the tip, or charging. Different generations have different pairing and charging methods.**

The Apple Pencil has four main versions as of 2026:

| Generation                 | Pairing / Charging Method                                   | Compatibility                                              | Key Features                                   |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Apple Pencil (1st Gen)** | Plug into iPad Lightning port to pair; charge via Lightning | iPad (6th-10th Gen), mini (5th), Air (3rd), Pro (pre-2018) | Pressure & Tilt sensitivity                    |

| **Apple Pencil (USB-C)**   | Pair and charge via USB-C cable                             | USB-C iPads (including M4 iPad Pro)                        | No pressure sensitivity                        |
| **Apple Pencil Pro**       | Magnetic attachment to side                                 | M4 iPad Pro, M2/M3 iPad Air, iPad mini 7                   | Squeeze, Barrel roll, Haptic feedback, Find My |

## Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Check Battery Level**:
   - **1st Gen**: Plug into iPad port.
   - **2nd Gen / Pro**: Attach magnetically to the side.
   - **USB-C**: Connect via cable.
   - Wait 10 minutes and check the "Batteries" widget on the iPad.

2. **Tighten the Tip**: A loose tip disrupts the signal. Gently twist the nib clockwise to secure it.

3. **Re-pair**:
   - Go to **Settings > Bluetooth**.
   - Find "Apple Pencil" in "My Devices".
   - Tap the **"i"** icon > **"Forget This Device"**.
   - Re-connect the Pencil to the iPad to pair again.

4. **Check Bluetooth**: Ensure Bluetooth is toggled ON.

## Institutional Advice:

If an Apple Pencil is left uncharged for more than 3 months (like over summer break), the tiny internal battery may enter "Deep Discharge" fail state. We recommend charging Pencils fully before storing them separately from iPads during long breaks.
