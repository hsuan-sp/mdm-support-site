**iPad performance is a balance between battery health, software demands, and hardware degradation. As a device enters its 4th or 5th year, multiple factors combine to cause noticeable lag.**

For project devices (like iPad 9) showing lag in late 2025, assess using these dimensions:

## 1. Power Management Throttling:

When a lithium battery’s ability to provide peak power declines, iPadOS limits the CPU/GPU speed to prevent unexpected shutdowns during high-load tasks (like AR or video editing).

- **Symptoms**: Apps take longer to launch, scrolling stutters, and keyboard input lags.
- **Status**: If cycle count is high, the system may throttle performance for stability even if the charge percentage looks full.

## 2. Software Resource Evolution (Software Bloat):

Modern versions of iPadOS (OS 18/26) and teaching apps require significantly more RAM (Random Access Memory) than they did four years ago.

- **Hardware Bottleneck**: Base models with only 3GB of RAM (like iPad 9) frequently perform "Memory Swapping" when handling complex web content, which creates a "stuck" feeling for the user.

## 3. Physical Hardware Decay:

Besides the battery, internal **NAND Flash storage** has a finite number of write cycles. After thousands of read/write operations, latency increases. Additionally, motherboard components degrade over time under constant thermal cycles. This is irreversible physical aging.

## Recommended Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Clear System Cache**: Go to **Settings > General > iPad Storage**. Ensure free space is greater than 10GB.
2. **Hard Restart**: Helps free up residual memory resources.
3. **Evaluate Replacement**: If running basic learning platforms or making slides feels significantly slow, the hardware spec may no longer support modern teaching needs.

## Practical Advice:

For iPads that have served over 4 years, schools should plan a "Tier 2" or "Retirement" program (e.g., repurposing them as library kiosks or admin-only single-app devices) and purchase new models with higher RAM and A/M series chips to maintain teaching quality.
