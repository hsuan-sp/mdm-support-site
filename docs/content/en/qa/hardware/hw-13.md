## Q: My iPad is lagging. Is it because of battery aging or old hardware?

## Answer

*  **iPad performance is a balance between battery health, software demands, and hardware degradation. As a device enters its 4th or 5th year, multiple factors combine to cause noticeable lag.**## 1. Power Management Throttling

When a lithium battery’s ability to provide peak power declines, iPadOS limits the CPU/GPU speed to prevent unexpected shutdowns during high-load tasks (like AR or video editing).***Symptoms**: Apps take longer to launch, scrolling stutters, and keyboard input lags.

## 2. Software Resource Evolution (Software Bloat)

Modern versions of iPadOS (OS 26) and teaching apps require significantly more RAM (Random Access Memory) than they did four years ago.***Bottleneck**: Base models with only 3GB of RAM (like iPad 9) frequently perform "Memory Swapping," which creates a "stuck" feeling for the user.

## 3. Physical Hardware Decay

Internal**NAND Flash storage**has a finite number of write cycles. After years of heavy use, read/write latency increases. Additionally, motherboard components degrade over time under constant thermal cycles, leading to irreversible performance loss.

## Practical Advice:

If a device is over 4 years old and lagging despite a fresh restore, it is likely a combination of RAM limitations and physical aging. Prioritize replacement for these units.
