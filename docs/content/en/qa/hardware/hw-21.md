## Q: 2024-2025 iPad Hardware Differences: M4 Pro, M2/M3 Air, iPad mini 7 (A17 Pro).

## Answer

** Newer iPads released in 2024–2025 feature significant hardware and management upgrades, specifically regarding Pencil compatibility, battery health, and high-speed networking. ** ## Management and Hardware Keys:

1. ** Pencil Compatibility Shift ** :

* ** M4 Pro / M2 Air / mini 7 ** : These models require the ** Apple Pencil Pro ** or the Apple Pencil (USB-C). They are ** not compatible ** with the 2nd Gen Magnetic Pencil. Procurement MUST check model numbers to avoid buying incompatible styluses.

1. ** Battery Management ** :

* These models include a new ** Battery Health ** menu similar to the iPhone 15, allowing administrators to see ** Cycle Counts ** directly. This is a massive improvement for fleet longevity tracking.

1. ** USB-C / Thunderbolt ** :

* The M4 Pro supports Thunderbolt (40Gbps), allowing for extremely fast external storage or dual-monitor configurations in labs. The Air and mini use standard USB-C (10Gbps).

1. ** Wi-Fi 7 and 6E ** :

* The M4 Pro and mini 7 support ** Wi-Fi 7 ** and ** 6E ** , providing better stability in congested school environments.

> [!CAUTION]
> If your school is mixing iPad 9 (Digital Initiative) with newer M-series models, pay close attention to the ** Charging Port ** (Lightning vs USB-C) and ** Pencil ** models during stock check.
