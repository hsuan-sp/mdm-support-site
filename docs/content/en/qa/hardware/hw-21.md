**Newer iPads released in 2024–2025 feature significant hardware and management upgrades, specifically regarding Pencil compatibility, battery health, and high-speed networking.**

## Core Hardware Differences:

| Feature          | iPad 9 (Digital Initiative) | New iPad Pro (M4)           | New iPad Air (M2)      | iPad mini 7 (A17 Pro)  |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Processor**    | A13 Bionic                  | **M4 (High AI Perf)**       | M2                     | A17 Pro                |
| **Screen**       | 10.2" LCD                   | **Ultra Retina XDR (OLED)** | Liquid Retina (LCD)    | 8.3" Liquid Retina     |
| **Port**         | Lightning                   | **Thunderbolt / USB 4**     | USB-C (10Gbps)         | USB-C (10Gbps)         |
| **Front Cam**    | Portrait Top                | **Landscape Center**        | **Landscape Center**   | Portrait Top           |
| **Apple Pencil** | 1st Gen                     | **Pencil Pro / USB-C**      | **Pencil Pro / USB-C** | **Pencil Pro / USB-C** |

## Management and Hardware Upgrades:

### 1. Advanced Battery Health Management

- **Exclusive Feature**: Only on M2/M4/A17 Pro models, "Cycle Count" and "Maximum Capacity" are visible.
- **Charge Limit**: Can be forced to **"80% Limit"**, which significantly extends battery life for devices stored in charging carts.

### 2. Apple Intelligence Support

- **Requirement**: Must be M1 chip or newer, or A17 Pro or newer.
- **Advice**: Create a Smart Group (Criteria: Chip contains M or A17) to scope AI restrictions or guides specifically to these high-end models.

### 3. Apple Pencil Pro Tracking

- **Find My**: The new Pencil Pro supports the "Find My" network. Admins can require teachers to bind the pencil to their "Managed Apple Account," drastically reducing loss rates.

## Procurement & Deployment Advice:

- **Color Coded Accessories**: Since Pencil Pro is incompatible with older models, we recommend using color-coded stickers (e.g., Metallic Blue) on both the new iPad and its Pencil to avoid mix-ups.
- **Charging Infrastructure**: M4 iPad Pro supports PD fast charging. Ensure your charging carts support 30W+ USB-C PD output to maintain charging efficiency.
