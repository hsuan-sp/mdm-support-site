**This is because iPadOS enables 'Private Wi-Fi Address' by default, generating a randomized virtual MAC address for each SSID.** This prevents commercial tracking but can break campus network systems that rely on "MAC Address Binding" for IP assignments or access control.

## Solution (via MDM):

Do not ask students to manually disable this. Instead, handle it centrally via Jamf Pro:

1. **Modify Profile**: Navigate to the **Wi-Fi Configuration Profile** assigned to students.

2. **Key Option**: In the Wi-Fi profile payload, check **"Disable MAC Address Randomization"**.
3. **Result**: When the device connects to that specific SSID, it will be forced to report its real hardware MAC address, allowing network infrastructure to identify the asset correctly.

## Why is this necessary?

- **Asset Auditing**: Network traffic logs can be matched precisely to physical serial numbers.
- **Security Tracing**: If improper network behavior occurs, the specific device can be located via its MAC address.
- **IP Assignment**: Ensures the DHCP server assigns the reserved static IP to the correct equipment.

## Important Note:

This setting only applies to the Wi-Fi network defined in the MDM profile. If students connect to a personal hotspot or home Wi-Fi, the system will still enable Private Address to protect their privacy—this does not affect school management.
