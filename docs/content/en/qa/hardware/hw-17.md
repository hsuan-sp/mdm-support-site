## Q: Can I see device warranty expiration dates directly in the MDM console?

## Answer

**Yes. Jamf Pro integrates with Apple’s Global Service Exchange (GSX) database to automatically pull 'Limited Warranty' status for every device.**

This is extremely helpful for auditing the Digital Initiative fleet in 2026.

## How to View:

* **Individual**: Check a device record under the**Purchasing**tab.
* **Fields**:
* **Warranty Expires**: The date Apple’s official system shows the warranty ends.
* **AppleCare++++++++++++ ID**: Shows the contract number if you have AppleCare+++++++++++++.

## The 'Project Warranty' Blind Spot:

In many MOE projects, schools receive a 4-year warranty. If this extra coverage is provided by a**"Reseller agreement"**rather than official AppleCare+++++++++++++:

* **Symptom**: Jamf may show the warranty as "Expired" (because it only sees the original 1-year Apple warranty).
* **Fix**: You must record the project-specific dates. Use**Extension Attributes**in Jamf Pro to create a custom field titled "Project Warranty End Date" and batch-upload the correct contract dates.

## Practical Advice:

Create an**Advanced Search**to list all devices where "Warranty Expiration" is "Before [Date]." This allows you to prioritize repairs before your official contract ends.
