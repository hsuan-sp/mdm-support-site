## Q: How do I handle 'Ghost Touch' or issues with auto-rotation on the screen?

## Answer

** 'Ghost Touch' (erratic touch input) typically involves Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) or a damaged digitizer layer. Auto-rotation issues are usually related to hardware failure of internal sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope). ** These issues directly impact the usability of the device. Administrators should distinguish between software settings, environmental interference, and pure hardware failure before deciding on a repair.

## Part 1: Troubleshooting Ghost Touch

## 1. Eliminate Electrical Noise and EMI

* ** Common Cause ** : Using non-original cables or unstable charging carts can generate "ripple noise" that interferes with the screen's capacitive sensor, causing erratic touches.
* ** The Big Test ** : ** Unplug all charging cables. ** If touch returns to normal while running strictly on battery, the problem lies with the charging equipment (cables or the PDU module in the cart). Switch to MFi-certified cables or inspect the cart.

## 2. Physical Cleaning and Pressure Check

* ** Cleaning ** : Ensure the screen edges are free from sweat, oils, or liquid seepage.
* ** Case Pressure ** : Check if a rugged case is too tight or if a screen protector is damaged at the edges, as this can transmit constant "false" pressure signals to the digitizer.

## 3. Hard Reset

* ** iPad 9th Gen (with Home Button) ** : Press and hold the Top button and the Home button until the Apple logo appears.
* ** iPad 10th Gen (no Home Button) ** : Press and release Volume Up, press and release Volume Down, then press and hold the Top button until the logo appears.

## Part 2: Determining Sensor Hardware Failure (Rotation)

If the iPad screen won't rotate with the device, check the following in order:

1. ** Control Center Lock ** : Ensure the "Rotation Lock" icon (a lock with a circular arrow) is not highlighted in red.

1. ** MDM Restriction Check ** : Admins should verify that a ** Restrictions ** profile in Jamf Pro hasn't accidentally enabled "Lock Screen Orientation," which would disable rotation for all scoped devices.

1. ** Sensor Self-Diagnosis ** :

* ** Logic ** : Rotation relies on the internal ** Accelerometer ** and ** Gyroscope ** .
* ** Test Method ** : Open the built-in ** Compass ** app. If the needle is completely frozen, or the level feature doesn't react to tilt, the internal sensor hardware is likely damaged.

## Practical Advice: Repair Strategy

* ** When to Repair ** : If Ghost Touch persists after removing external power and cleaning, or if the Compass app is unresponsive, it typically indicates a damaged ** digitizer layer ** or ** logic board sensor ** .
* ** Contract Coverage ** : Provided there is no obvious physical damage or screen cracks, these issues are generally considered natural hardware failures. Contact support immediately to facilitate repair or replacement under your project's warranty.
