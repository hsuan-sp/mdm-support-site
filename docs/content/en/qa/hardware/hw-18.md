**iPadOS 26.2 and macOS Tahoe 26.2 unlock support for 160 MHz bandwidth on compatible Wi-Fi 6E hardware, significantly increasing throughput.** M5 devices launched in 2025 further support Wi-Fi 7, offering higher speeds and lower latency. If your speeds haven't improved, it is likely an Access Point (AP) configuration or interference issue.

## Enabling Conditions:

### Wi-Fi 6E (160 MHz) Support

1. **Compatible Hardware**:
   - iPad Pro 11"/13" (M2, M4 chips)
   - MacBook Pro (M2 Pro/Max, M3, M4 series)
   - Mac mini (M2 Pro, M4)
2. **OS Version**: Must be updated to **iPadOS 26.2** or **macOS Tahoe 26.2** or later.
3. **Access Point (AP)**:
   - Must support **802.11ax 6 GHz**.
   - Must constitute **160 MHz** channel width on 6 GHz (configured by network admin).
   - Security must be **WPA3** (Mandated by Wi-Fi 6E specs).

### Wi-Fi 7 Support (2025+ Models)

1. **Supported Devices**:
   - **M5 iPad Pro** (11"/13", released Oct 2025)
   - **M5 MacBook Pro** (14", released Oct 2025)
   - **iPhone 16 Series** (Sep 2024, first Apple devices with Wi-Fi 7)
2. **Note**:
   - **M4 Series Devices** (2024-2025 MacBook Air/iMac/Mac mini) only support Wi-Fi 6E, not Wi-Fi 7.
   - Wi-Fi 7 requires compatible APs and routers; current campus deployments are mostly Wi-Fi 6/6E.

## Troubleshooting: Why is it still slow?

- **Reason 1: Connected to 5 GHz instead of 6 GHz (Wi-Fi 6E)**
  - Many schools use Band Steering on a single SSID. If the 6 GHz signal is weak, the device drops back to 5 GHz.
  - **Solution**: Set a dedicated 6 GHz SSID (e.g., `School-6E`) for high-performance needs.
- **Reason 2: Hardware supports Wi-Fi 7 but AP is only Wi-Fi 6/6E**
  - If you bought M5 iPad Pros but the APs are older, they will downgrade connection speed.
  - **Solution**: Evaluate if infrastructure upgrade to Wi-Fi 7 APs is needed.
- **Reason 3: WPA3 Compatibility**: Wi-Fi 6E forces WPA3. Old RADIUS servers may reject the connection.
- **Reason 4: Ethernet Bottleneck**: If the AP's uplink port is only 1 Gbps, 2.4 Gbps Wi-Fi is bottlednecked. Upgrade to **2.5 GbE or 10 GbE** switches.
