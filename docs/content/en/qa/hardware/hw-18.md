## Q: How do I enable Wi-Fi 6E 160 MHz on iPad Pro and Mac? Why isn't my speed improving?

## Answer

*  **iPadOS 26.2 and macOS Tahoe 26.2 unlock support for 160 MHz bandwidth on compatible Wi-Fi 6E hardware, significantly increasing throughput. M5 devices launched in 2025 further support Wi-Fi 7.**If your speeds haven't improved, it is likely an Access Point (AP) configuration or interference issue.

## Requirements for 160 MHz (Wi-Fi 6E):

1. **Compatible Hardware**: iPad Pro (M2/M4), MacBook Pro (M2-M4), Mac mini (M2/M4).
2. **OS Version**: Updated to**v26.2**or later.
3. **Access Point (AP)**:***Must support**802.11ax 6 GHz**.***Must be configured specifically for**160 MHz**on the 6 GHz band (requires IT config).***Security must be**WPA 3**(Mandated by Wi-Fi 6E specs).

## Wi-Fi 7 (2025+ Models):***M5 iPad Pro**and**iPhone 16**series are among the first to support Wi-Fi 7.***Note:**M4 models**(2024 iMac/Mac mini) only support up to Wi-Fi 6E.

## Why is it still slow?***Band Steering**: If you use the same SSID for all frequencies, the device might drop back to 5 GHz if the 6 GHz signal is weak.**Recommendation**: Set a dedicated 6 GHz SSID (e.g., `Classroom-6E`).***Ethernet Bottleneck**: If your AP’s uplink is only 1 Gbps, you won't see the benefit of 2.4 Gbps Wi-Fi speeds. Ensure your switches are**2.5 GbE or 10 GbE**.***WPA 3 Issues**: Wi-Fi 6E requires WPA 3; if your RADIUS server is too old to handle it, devices will fail to connect at these high speeds.
