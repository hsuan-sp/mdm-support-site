**The Apple Pencil Pro (released May 2024) is the first Apple stylus to support the 'Find My' network. This is a game-changer for schools, as it allows for tracking even when the pencil is not magnetised to an iPad.**

## How Tracking Works:

- **Bluetooth Discovery**: Pencil Pro sends a secure Bluetooth signal that nearby Apple devices can detect and relay to the Find My network.
- **Precision Finding**: If the pencil is lost nearby (e.g., behind a cabinet), you can use an iPhone or iPad to get "Warm/Cold" guidance to its exact location.

## Setup Steps (Teachers & Admins):

1. **Account Binding**: The Pencil Pro must be paired with a "Managed Apple Account" or personal Apple ID.
2. **Enable Find My**: On the paired iPad, ensure **Settings > [User Name] > Find My > Find My iPad** is ENABLED. This automatically enables tracking for the Pencil.

## When a Student Reports it Lost:

1. Open the **Find My App** on the iPad.
2. Tap the **Items** tab.
3. Select the specific Apple Pencil Pro.
4. **Choose Action**:
   - **Play Sound**: Not applicable (Pencil has no speaker).
   - **Directions**: Shows the last known location on a map.
   - **Find**: (Precision Finding) Shows distance and direction when within ~10 meters.

## Limitations & Notes:

- **Battery Dependency**: If the Pencil is dead for over 24 hours, the signal will fade and stop.
- **iCloud Restrictions**: If "Find My" is disabled via MDM on the student account, this feature won't work.
- **Model Specific**: This only works for **Apple Pencil Pro**. 1st Gen, 2nd Gen, and USB-C models do not have this hardware.

## Practical Advice:

When issuing Apple Pencil Pros, require teachers to rename each pencil to a unique ID (e.g., "104-Pencil-01") for easy identification in the Find My list.
