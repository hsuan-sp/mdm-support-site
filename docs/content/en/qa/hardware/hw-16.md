## Q: Will the Apple Pencil break if left in its tray for 3 months without charging?

## Answer

** There is a risk of damage. Apple Pencils use tiny lithium-polymer batteries. If left at 'zero' or 'low' charge for an extended period, they can experience 'Deep Discharge,' rendering them unable to take a charge again. ** This is a common cause for support tickets after summer or winter breaks.

## Battery Characteristics & Risks:

* ** Tiny Capacity ** : Because the battery is so small, self-discharge is more impactful.
* ** Safety Lock ** : If voltage drops below a safe threshold, the battery's protection circuit "locks" the battery for safety. Symptoms include the pencil being warm when plugged in but showing 0% charge, or failing to pair via Bluetooth.

## Practical Maintenance Tips:

1. ** Pre-Holiday SOP ** :

* ** 1st Gen / USB-C (Wired) ** : Fully charge it, then store it separately from the iPad.
* ** 2nd Gen / Pencil Pro (Magnetic)

** : ** Warning ** : If the iPad is powered off and unplugged, the pencil attached to its side will continue to slowly drain power from the iPad to monitor the magnetic signal. Fully charge the pencil and ** store it separately ** from the iPad.

1. ** Apple Pencil Pro Benefit ** : These support the "Find My" network. Even if stored separately, you can still locate them via the Find My app after the break.

1. ** Mid-Break Check ** : If storing for over 2 months, try to give the pencil a 15-minute "top-off" charge once to keep the chemistry active.

## Troubleshooting:

If a pencil is unresponsive after a break, leave it charging for at least ** 30-60 minutes ** . Waking a deeply discharged battery takes significantly longer than normal charging.
