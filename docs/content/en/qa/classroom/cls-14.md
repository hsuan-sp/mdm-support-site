**AirDrop is a primary source of classroom distraction. We recommend either constant restrictions via MDM or dynamic control by the teacher.**

## Three Levels of Control:

1. **Fully Disable (Strict - Ideal for Exams)** :

- In a Restrictions profile, **uncheck 'Allow AirDrop'** .
- **Result** : The AirDrop icon disappears from the Control Center, and no one can send or receive files.

1. **Force 'Contacts Only' (Balanced)** :

- Check **Force AirDrop to be treated as unmanaged destination** (or similar "Contacts Only" profile restriction).
- Since student iPads typically lack each other's contact info, this blocks pranks from strangers while allowing communication with the teacher (if stored as a contact).

1. **Jamf Teacher Dynamic Control (Most Flexible)** :

- Keep AirDrop enabled normally for file submissions.
- During a lesson, the teacher can tap **Disable AirDrop** in the Jamf Teacher app. AirDrop is immediately disabled for the class and automatically restores once the session ends.
