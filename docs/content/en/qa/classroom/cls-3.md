## Q: Why is the web navigation failing when I try to push a URL to student iPads?

## Answer

*  **Navigation failures are typically caused by browser restrictions, content filters, or excessive open tabs.**## Troubleshooting Checklist:

1. **Safari is Disabled**: Verify if Safari has been hidden or disabled via a management profile. If the browser is unavailable, the push command has nowhere to go.
2. **Web Content Filtering**: If your school uses a strict "allowlist," and the URL you are pushing (e.g., a specific YouTube video or external blog) is not on that list, Safari will block the page from loading.
3. **Tab Fatigue**: If a student has dozens of open tabs, older iPad models may run out of memory and fail to open a new one. Ask students to clear their Safari tabs and try again.
4. **URL Format**: Ensure the URL you are typing includes the full `https://` prefix.

## Best Practice for Teachers:

Save your frequently used teaching links in your own iPad’s**Safari Bookmarks**. When using the "Navigate" tool in Classroom, you can select these bookmarks directly, reducing the chance of typing errors or formatting issues.
