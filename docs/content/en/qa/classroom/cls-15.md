## Q: If a student iPad fails and they use a loaner, will their data still be there?

## Answer

**This depends on whether the data is stored 'Locally' or in the 'Cloud'.** ## Fate of Data Types:

1. **Cloud Data (Safe)** :

* If the student routinely saves work to **Google Drive, OneDrive, or iCloud Drive** .
* Signing into the cloud app or the Managed Apple Account on the new device will cause files to appear automatically.

1. **Local Data (High Risk)** :

* If the student saves Keynote/Pages projects only to the "On My iPad" location and the school **has not enabled** Managed iCloud backups.
* That data will disappear along with the failing device and **cannot** be retrieved on a loaner.

## Practical Advice:

Education versions of iCloud provide 200GB of space. Administrators can enable **Allow iCloud Backup** in Jamf Pro. This allows students to select "Restore from iCloud Backup" when signing into a new device, restoring their wallpaper, app layout, and local data.
