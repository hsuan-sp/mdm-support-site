**Yes. Without a caching mechanism, 30 iPads requesting data individually from the internet will likely saturate your school's outbound bandwidth.**

## The Role of Content Caching:

Content Caching is a feature on a local Mac (e.g., a Mac mini) that stores content from **Apple's official servers** locally.

- **Supported Content** :
- iOS / iPadOS system updates (the single largest bandwidth consumer).
- Apps downloaded from the App Store.
- Course files stored in iCloud Drive (e.g., Keynote, Pages, PDFs).
- Photos and backups uploaded to iCloud.
- **Unsupported Content** :
- **YouTube videos, Netflix, and general web browsing.** This traffic does **not** go through Content Caching and will still consume outbound bandwidth.

## Practical Benefits:

When the first student in a class downloads 2GB of GarageBand, a copy is cached on the local Mac. When the remaining 29 students download the same app, it is served directly from that Mac at local network speeds, consuming zero outbound bandwidth from the school.
