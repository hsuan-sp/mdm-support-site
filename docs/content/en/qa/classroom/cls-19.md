## Q: Troubleshooting: Apple Pencil won't pair or write. How do I fix it?

## Answer

** Apple Pencil issues are usually caused by 'Model Incompatibility' or 'Bluetooth Pairing Cache' errors. ** ## Troubleshooting Flow:

1. ** Verify Compatibility (Most Common Error) ** :

* ** 1st Gen (Lightning) ** : Does not work with common USB-C iPads (unless using an adapter).
* ** 2nd Gen (Magnetic) ** : Only for iPad Air/Pro models with the magnetic charging strip.
* ** USB-C Model ** : Does not support magnetic pairing; must be connected via ** cable ** for initial setup.

1. ** Reset Bluetooth ** :

* Go to ** Settings > Bluetooth ** , find the old Apple Pencil entry, and select ** Forget This Device ** .
* Re-attach or re-plug the Apple Pencil to re-pair.

1. ** Check the Tip ** :

* If it pairs but won't write, the ** tip is often loose ** . Try tightening it by turning it clockwise.

1. ** MDM Restrictions ** :

* Ensure the MDM "Restrictions" profile does not have ** Disallow modifying Bluetooth settings ** checked, as this may block new pairing attempts.
