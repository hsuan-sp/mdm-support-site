## Q: iPads are making noise and disrupting class. Can the teacher 'Mute All' at once?

## Answer

** Yes, the teacher can 'Mute' the whole class with one click, but they cannot 'Unmute' them remotely. ** ## Operation:

Within the ** Classroom ** app's main screen, tap the ** Mute ** icon. The media volume on all student iPads will immediately drop to zero.

## Technical Restriction (Privacy Policy):

* ** Down, not Up ** : For privacy and security reasons, the Apple MDM protocol ** does not allow ** remote volume increases or unmuting. This prevents potential abuse, such as an administrator blasting loud audio at night.
* ** Restoration ** : After a mute command is sent, students must ** manually ** use the physical volume buttons on their iPads to turn the sound back up. The teacher cannot do this for them.
