## Q: What is the difference between 'Jamf Teacher' and 'Apple Classroom'? Which one should I use?

## Answer

**These are complementary tools. Apple Classroom excels at 'Close-range Monitoring,' while Jamf Teacher is built for 'Remote Restriction'.** ## Feature Comparison:

| Feature | Apple Classroom | Jamf Teacher |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Connectivity** | **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi** (Proximity required) | **Wi-Fi/Cellular** (Works remotely) |
| **Strengths** | **View Student Screens** , Launch URLs | **App Locking** , **Feature Restrictions** (e.g., disable camera) |
| **Locking Level** | Locks to a single app; ends when disconnected | Create "Lessons" allowing multiple apps; others are hidden |
| **Duration** | Ends when class session is manually stopped | Can set a timer (e.g., 40 mins) to auto-restore |

## Best Use Cases:

* **During Lesson Monitoring** : Use **Apple Classroom** to keep an eye on active screens.
* **Focus/Exam Mode** : Use **Jamf Teacher** . It is more powerful for hiding irrelevant apps (games, browsers) and doesn't rely on Bluetooth proximity.
