## Q: How do I prevent students from getting distracted by 'Windowed Apps' in iPadOS 26?

## Answer

** iPadOS 26 introduces a new 'Windowed Apps' multitasking system, allowing apps to appear in resizable, overlapping windows. While great for productivity, it can lead to distraction. Schools can manage this via segmented MDM restrictions or use the 'Classroom' app for temporary focus locking. ** ## Multitasking in iPadOS 26

* ** Full Screen ** : Default single app view.
* ** Windowed Apps ** : Resizable windows that can overlap and move.
* ** Split View ** : Two apps side-by-side.
* ** Slide Over (v26.2+) ** : A floating window pinned above others.

## Three Management Strategies

## Strategy 1: Fully Disable Multitasking (Best for lower grades)

Younger students may find the windowed interface confusing or use it to hide apps from the teacher.

* ** Path ** : Jamf Pro > Configuration Profiles > Restrictions > Functionality.
* ** Action ** : Uncheck ** Allow Multitasking ** .
* ** Effect ** : The iPad returns to a strict single-app-at-a-time interface. Simple and intuitive.

## Strategy 2: Temporary Lock during Lessons (Best for middle/high school)

Allow multitasking normally, but lock it down when focus is required.

* ** Tool ** : ** Apple Classroom ** or ** Jamf Teacher ** .
* ** Action ** :

1. Select the class or specific students.
1. Select ** Open App ** and check ** Lock in App after opening ** .
1. Select the required app (e.g., Keynote).

* ** Effect ** : The student’s iPad is locked into that specific app in Full Screen mode. They cannot switch to windows or other apps until the teacher clicks "Unlock."

## Strategy 3: Digital Literacy & Guided Use

Maintain multitasking but enforce class norms.

* ** Approach ** : Establish a "Courseware Only" policy.
* ** Monitoring ** : Use the "Screen View" feature in Apple Classroom to perform spot checks.
* ** Education ** : Teach students multitasking gestures (like the three-finger swipe up) to manage their workspace professionally.
