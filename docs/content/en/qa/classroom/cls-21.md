## Q: Can a teacher force a student's screen to project to an Apple TV?

## Answer

** Yes. Using the 'Classroom' app, a teacher can direct any student's screen to project via AirPlay without the student needing to take any action. ** ## Operation:

1. In the ** Classroom ** app, tap on the student.
1. Tap the ** AirPlay ** icon.
1. Select the ** Apple TV ** or AirPlay-compatible display in the room.
1. The student's screen will immediately be projected.

## Essential Security Settings:

To prevent students from "hijacking" the screen, administrators should configure the ** Apple TV ** to ** Require Passcode ** or be ** On-Network only ** . In Jamf Pro, you can also enable ** Force AirPlay outgoing requests to accept pairing password ** in a Restrictions profile to ensure the teacher maintains control.
