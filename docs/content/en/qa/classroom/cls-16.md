**This is a common student deflection tactic. Administrators can use MDM to prevent students from 'modifying' these settings, but the logic differs between Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.**

## MDM Countermeasures (Restrictions Profile):

In the Jamf Pro **Restrictions** payload, there are two key options:

1. **Wi-Fi: Force On**:
   - Check **Force Wi-Fi on**.
   - **Result**: If a student attempts to turn it off, the system will immediately toggle it back on, or the button will be grayed out. This ensures the device remains online.

2. **Bluetooth: Lock State (High Risk!)**:
   - Uncheck **Allow modifying Bluetooth settings**.
   - **Result**: This "freezes" the Bluetooth toggle in its **current state**.
   - **⚠️ Severe Risk**: If you push this restriction while a student's Bluetooth is **OFF**, that device’s Bluetooth will be **permanently locked in the off state**. The student cannot turn it on, and the teacher cannot connect via Apple Classroom.

## Practical Advice:

- **Announcement first**: Before pushing a Bluetooth restriction, ensure all students have their Bluetooth **ON**.
- **Remedy**: If a device gets "locked in the OFF state," the administrator must remove the device from the restriction scope, wait for the profile to clear, manually turn Bluetooth ON, and then re-scope it.
- **Scope wisely**: We recommend enforcing this only on school-owned specialized sets; for BYOD, locking Bluetooth may interfere with personal peripherals like headphones.
