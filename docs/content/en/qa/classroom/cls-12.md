**For devices running iOS 26+, administrators should use 'Declarative Device Management (DDM)' for real-time control.**

## Risk Features and Controls:

- **Writing Tools** : Disable via the DDM **Restrictions** declaration using `allowWritingTools`.
- **Math Notes** : Disable using `allowMathNotes`.
- **Genmoji and Image Playground** : Disable using `allowGenmoji` and `allowImagePlayground`.

## Setup Path (Jamf Pro):

1. Go to **Blueprints** or **Declarations** .
1. Add a **Restrictions** declaration.
1. Block the AI features listed above. DDM is "instant," making it ideal for deployment right before an exam.

1. **Unmanaged Devices** : If students use personal devices, administrators can turn off Apple Intelligence permissions for Managed Apple Accounts at the tenant level in **ASM (Apple School Manager) > Service Access** .

## Hardware Requirements:

- Apple Intelligence is only supported on devices with **M-series chips** or **A17 Pro and later** . ** Note: Entry-level iPads (e.g., 10th and 11th Gen with A14/A16 chips) do not support these AI features natively. Focus your management efforts on iPad Air and iPad Pro models with M-series chips.*
