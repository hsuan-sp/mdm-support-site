## Q: How do I prevent students from cheating using Apple Intelligence (Writing Tools) or Math Notes?

## Answer

*  **For devices running iOS 26+, administrators should use 'Declarative Device Management (DDM)' for real-time control.**## Risk Features and Controls:***Writing Tools**: Disable via the DDM**Restrictions**declaration using `allowWritingTools`.***Math Notes**: Disable using `allowMathNotes`.***Genmoji and Image Playground**: Disable using `allowGenmoji`and`allowImagePlayground`.

## Setup Path (Jamf Pro):

1. Go to**Blueprints**or**Declarations**.
2. Add a**Restrictions**declaration.
3. Block the AI features listed above. DDM is "instant," making it ideal for deployment right before an exam.
4. **Unmanaged Devices**: If students use personal devices, administrators can turn off Apple Intelligence permissions for Managed Apple Accounts at the tenant level in**ASM (Apple School Manager) > Service Access**.

## Hardware Requirements:***Apple Intelligence is only supported on devices with**M-series chips**or**A17 Pro and later**.***Note: Entry-level iPads (e.g., 10th and 11th Gen with A14/A16 chips) do not support these AI features natively. Focus your management efforts on iPad Air and iPad Pro models with M-series chips.**
