## Q: Will the 'AirDrop Code' in iOS 26.2 affect school management policies? Can students use it to bypass restrictions?

## Answer

** The 'AirDrop Code' is a privacy enhancement in iOS 26.2. It does NOT allow students to bypass MDM-enforced 'Disable AirDrop' settings. Your existing security policies remain effective. ** ## How AirDrop Codes Work

In iOS/iPadOS/macOS 26.2, a 6-digit temporary authorization code can be used to establish a "trusted relationship" between two people who are not in each other's contacts.

* ** Security ** : This is a way to safely add "Known Contacts" temporarily (for 30 days) without exchanging permanent phone numbers or emails.
* ** Termination ** : The relationship automatically expires after 30 days, or can be manually "forgotten" in the Contacts app.

## Impact Analysis for Schools

## Scenario 1: MDM set to 'AirDrop - Receiving Off'

* ** Result ** : AirDrop is completely disabled.
* ** Impact of Code ** : ** None ** . Even if a student generates a code, the AirDrop system remains powered down and unreachable.

## Scenario 2: MDM set to 'AirDrop - Contacts Only'

* ** Result ** : Students can only swap files with people in their address book.
* ** Impact of Code ** : ** Applicable ** . Students can use an AirDrop Code to temporarily treat a classmate as a "Known Contact" for 30 days. This makes a lot of sense for collaborative projects where students don't need to be permanent friends. It is a privacy-friendly way to enable file sharing without relaxing the "Everyone" restriction.

## Scenario 3: MDM set to 'AirDrop - Everyone for 10 Minutes'

* ** Result ** : Open to all.
* ** Impact of Code ** : Irrelevant, as the system is already open.

## Administrative Advice

1. ** For Exams ** : Keep AirDrop set to ** 'Receiving Off' ** via MDM. This renders all codes useless and prevents illicit file sharing.

1. ** For Daily Lessons ** : ** 'Contacts Only' ** is the recommended setting. The AirDrop Code feature actually makes this setting*more* useful for schools, as students can share files for class projects without the privacy risk of exchanging personal contact details.

1. ** Governance ** : Remind students that an AirDrop Code is a key—only give it to people you trust to send you academic material.
