## Q: Can students leave or remove 'Classroom' classes created by the teacher?

## Answer

** This depends on the source of the class. **** Classes synced from your school system cannot be removed, but teacher-created ad-hoc classes can—unless restricted via MDM. ** ## Difference Between the Two Class Types:

## 1. ASM-synced Classes (Apple School Manager)

* ** Source ** : Created by administrators in ASM or a Student Information System (SIS) and deployed via MDM.
* ** Student Rights ** : ** Cannot be removed. ** These are considered permanent educational configurations.
* On the iPad under ** Settings > Classroom ** , students can view class info but will find no "Remove Class" option.

## 2. Teacher-created Classes (Ad-hoc)

* ** Source ** : Created by a teacher directly in the Classroom app. Students join via an invite code (often referred to as "Nearby Classes").
* ** Student Rights ** : ** Can be removed by default. ** In ** Settings > Classroom ** , students can tap "Edit" in the top right to select ** "Remove Class" ** and exit management.

## Management Solution (For Teacher-created Classes):

If the school allows teachers to create their own classes but wants to prevent students from leaving them, the administrator must modify the ** Restrictions ** profile in Jamf Pro. ** Uncheck ** (disable) the following option:

* ** "Allow leaving classes created by the teacher" **** (Note: This restriction only applies to Supervised devices.)*
