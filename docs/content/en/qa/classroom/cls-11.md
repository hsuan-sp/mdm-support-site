## Q: Why can't I see the device's real MAC address after iPadOS 17? (Private Wi-Fi Address)

## Answer

*  **This is because Apple enables the 'Private Wi-Fi Address' feature by default.**In newer versions of iOS/iPadOS, this feature offers two modes:***Fixed Mode**(Default): Provides a unique, random MAC address for a specific Wi-Fi network to prevent cross-network tracking.***Rotating Mode**: Changes the MAC address approximately every two weeks for maximum security.

Since the device broadcasts a virtual MAC, traditional network management systems cannot identify the hardware.

## Impact:***DHCP Assignments**: If your school DHCP server relies on MAC binding for static IPs, this feature causes IPs to change constantly.***Audit Logging**: Firewalls cannot track specific student activity via hardware MAC.

## MDM Solution (School-wide Disable):

1. Edit a**Wi-Fi**configuration profile in Jamf Pro.
2. In the Wi-Fi payload, check**Disable MAC Address Randomization**(also known as Disable Private Address).
3. Deploy this profile to your devices.

## Result:

When the device connects to the *specific SSID**(e.g., School-Student) defined in the profile, it will be forced to use its**Real Hardware MAC Address.******Note: This only applies to the Wi-Fi network specified in that profile. When students connect to their home Wi-Fi, the privacy feature will automatically re-enable.**
