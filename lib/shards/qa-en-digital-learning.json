          "question": "The VPN icon disappeared after updating to iPadOS 17. Is this normal?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>Yes, this is completely normal. It reflects a shift in the management architecture designed to optimize connection speeds and ensure compatibility with local educational network standards.</strong> In alignement with the latest digital learning policies, the <strong>Jamf Trust</strong> agent has transitioned from a full-tunnel VPN to a more efficient <strong>“DNS Proxy”</strong> and <strong>“Content Filter”</strong> architecture.</p>\n<h2>Key Changes:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Icon Removal</strong>: Because the system no longer creates a global VPN tunnel, the “VPN” label is no longer displayed in the status bar. This does <strong>not</strong> mean the device is unprotected.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Performance</strong>: This new architecture significantly reduces battery drain and resolves common issues such as network lag during classroom app updates.</li>\n<li><strong>Local Network Compatibility</strong>: By moving away from a traditional VPN tunnel, devices can communicate more efficiently with local campus caching servers, ensuring that heavy educational content (like video lessons) loads faster.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How to Verify Protection is Active:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check the App</strong>: Open the <strong>Jamf Trust</strong> app on the iPad. If you see a <strong>Green Shield (Protected)</strong>, the filtering and data reporting functions are operating correctly.</li>\n<li><strong>Inventory Status</strong>: In the Jamf Pro dashboard, verify that the “Content Filter” and “DNS Proxy” configuration profiles are listed as “Installed” for that device.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Institutional Advice:</h2>\n<p>If you see yellow or red warnings inside the Jamf Trust app regarding “Passcode not set” or “OS outdated,” you can usually ignore these as long as the main shield remains green. The device is still successfully reporting its status for compliance purposes.</p>\n",

          "question": "The MOE dashboard shows some devices as 'Unused' or failing to upload data. How do we fix this?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>Incomplete usage data is usually caused by the Jamf Trust agent being closed, devices staying offline, or missing configuration profiles.</strong> For institutional compliance, the Jamf Trust app must remain active in the background to report student engagement. If a device shows zero activity, follow these steps:</p>\n<h2>Common Causes &amp; Solutions:</h2>\n<h3>1. App being Force-Closed (Most Common)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Issue</strong>: Students often “swipe up” to close all apps in the multitasking view. This kills the Jamf Trust background process, stopping all data reporting.</li>\n<li><strong>The Fix</strong>: Educate students that Jamf Trust is a “System Service” that must always be left open in the background. Note: You can also use MDM restrictions to prevent students from removing the app entirely.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Network Firewall Blocks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Issue</strong>: The device is on Wi-Fi, but the campus firewall is blocking the specific AWS or Jamf Cloud ports required for reporting.</li>\n<li><strong>Test</strong>: Connect the device to a mobile hotspot. If the data uploads immediately, you need to ask the network administrator to allowlist Jamf’s reporting domains.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Profile Desynchronization</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Issue</strong>: The app is installed, but the <strong>DNS Proxy</strong> or <strong>Content Filter</strong> profile is missing or inactive.</li>\n<li><strong>The Fix</strong>: Send an <strong>“Update Inventory”</strong> command via Jamf Pro. If the problem persists, re-push the Jamf Trust configuration profile to the affected devices.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Operational Note:</h2>\n<p>Usage dashboards often have a <strong>T+1 delay</strong> (24-hour lag). If you fix a device today, you likely won’t see the updated status in the official MOE portal until the following day.</p>\n",

          "question": "How do I perform a 'Reset Network Settings'? What are the risks to my MDM connection?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>Resetting network settings is a powerful way to solve stubborn Wi-Fi issues, but it carries the risk of making the device an “unmanaged device” if not handled carefully.</strong></p>\n<h2>The “unmanaged device” Risk:</h2>\n<p>If you are in the middle of a Wi-Fi migration (transitioning from an old SSID to a new official school network), <strong>do not delete the old profile first</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Correct Process</strong>: Push the new Wi-Fi profile via MDM -&gt; Verify connection -&gt; Only then remove the old setting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Danger</strong>: If you reset all network settings and the iPad cannot “auto-join” any available school Wi-Fi, it will lose its connection to Jamf Pro. You will then have to manually reconnect every device by hand to restore management.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>When to Perform a Reset:</h2>\n<p>Use this only when the device shows “Unable to Join Network,” fails to see any Bluetooth devices, or Jamf Trust is permanently stuck in a “Connecting” loop that a restart won’t fix.</p>\n<h2>Steps to Reset:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Transfer or Reset iPad &gt; Reset</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Reset Network Settings</strong>. The iPad will reboot.</li>\n<li><strong>After Reboot</strong>: All saved Wi-Fi passwords and Bluetooth pairings are wiped. Managed Wi-Fi profiles pushed by the school should automatically re-apply once the device is unlocked and detects the campus signal.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Practical Tip:</h2>\n<p>Before resorting to a full network reset, always try toggling <strong>Airplane Mode</strong> for 10 seconds or performing a hard restart. These solve 90% of connectivity hang-ups without erasing your saved configurations.</p>\n",

          "answer": "<p><strong>Smart Groups are the “sorting bins” of Jamf Pro. They allow you to automatically categorize devices based on their purchase year, model, or health status.</strong> Using Smart Groups, you can target specific “batches” of hardware with unique apps or restrictions without having to manually select each iPad.</p>\n<h2>Common Logic Examples:</h2>\n<h3>1. Based on Naming Conventions (Recommended)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If you named your new arrivals with a year prefix (e.g., <code>2025-iPad-001</code>).</li>\n<li><strong>Criterion</strong>: Device Name <strong>like</strong> <code>2025-%</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Result</strong>: All devices from the 2025 intake are instantly grouped for easy management.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Based on Asset Tags</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If you uploaded a CSV of your asset tags into Jamf.</li>\n<li><strong>Criterion</strong>: Asset Tag <strong>is</strong> <code>EDU-PROJ-A</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. To Monitor Failure Points</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Criterion</strong>: Application Title <strong>does not have</strong> <code>Jamf Trust</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: This creates a “Live Hit List” of every device that has accidentally lost its reporting agent, allowing the ICT team to intervene precisely.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to Set it Up:</h2>\n<p>Log in to Jamf Pro &gt; <strong>Devices &gt; Smart Device Groups &gt; New</strong>.

          "question": "Students are deleting the Jamf Trust app. How does this affect compliance, and how do we prevent it?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>Deleting Jamf Trust effectively blinds your reporting system. The device will be marked as “Unused” in official compliance audits, even if the student is using it for class every day.</strong> To ensure your school meets its Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), you must implement technical safeguards.</p>\n<h2>Barrier 1: Prevent App Deletion (Most Effective)</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>In Jamf Pro, edit the <strong>Restrictions</strong> profile assigned to the student devices.</li>\n<li>Uncheck the box for <strong>“Allow removing apps.”</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The Result</strong>: When a student long-presses any icon, the “Delete” option simply does not appear. This is the most robust way to ensure the agent remains on the device.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Barrier 2: Automated Self-Healing</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>In the Jamf Pro settings for the Jamf Trust app, ensure the Distribution Method is set to <strong>“Install Automatically.”</strong></li>\n<li>Make sure the app is “In Scope” for all student groups.</li>\n<li>Even if a student manages to bypass restrictions and delete the app, the device will detect the “Missing App” status during its next check-in and forcefully reinstall Jamf Trust in the background.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Institutional Advice:</h2>\n<p>Create a Smart Group for “Devices Missing Jamf Trust” (Logic: Application Title <em>does not have</em> Jamf Trust).

          "answer": "<p><strong>Filtering rules for the Digital Learning Project are typically managed by higher-level authorities (Educational Bureaus). Modifying the blocklist is not recommended, but if an immediate exception is required for teaching, an “Exclusion” strategy is preferred.</strong></p>\n<p>Depending on your specific needs, you can choose one of the following solutions:</p>\n<h2>Method 1: Temporarily Exclude the Device (Jamf Trust Scope Exclusion)</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Jamf Pro.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the Jamf Trust <strong>Configuration Profile (DNS Proxy / Content Filter)</strong>.</li>\n<li>Go to <strong>Scope &gt; Exclusions</strong>.</li>\n<li>Add the teacher’s iPad or a specific class group to the exclusion list.</li>\n<li>Once saved, the device will remove the filtering settings upon its next check-in, allowing access to sites like YouTube.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: Ensure you remove the exclusion after class. Otherwise, the device will permanently lack protection and data reporting.</p>\n<h2>Method 2: AirPlay via Teacher Device</h2>\n<p>If students only need to “view” content rather than “interact” with it, it is recommended that the teacher play the video on their own device (which typically has less restrictive filtering) and project it to the classroom Apple TV via AirPlay.</p>\n<h2>Practical Advice: Risk Management</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data Interruption</strong>: Once a device is excluded from the Jamf Trust scope, <strong>traffic data reporting stops completely.</strong> Avoid long-term exclusions for student devices, as this will affect the school’s usage rate KPIs.</li>\n<li><strong>Content Control</strong>: Once unblocked, students can access all websites (including inappropriate content).

          "question": "Why is 'iCloud Private Relay' forced off on school iPads? Does this affect privacy?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>This policy ensures that ‘Jamf Trust’ functions correctly. Enabling this feature would disable the school’s content filtering and stop usage data reporting.</strong></p>\n<h2>Current Situation:</h2>\n<p>On Supervised devices within the Digital Learning Project, you will typically find the “Private Relay” switch under <strong>Settings &gt; iCloud</strong> is <strong>greyed out and set to ‘Off’.</strong> This is a mandatory restriction enforced via MDM configuration profiles.</p>\n<h2>Why Must it be Disabled? (Technical Conflict)</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Filtering Failure</strong>: iCloud Private Relay encrypts DNS queries and routes them through Apple’s relays. This prevents Jamf Trust from identifying whether a student is visiting inappropriate or malicious sites, effectively bypassing the “Safe Search” features.</li>\n<li><strong>Data Loss</strong>: Because traffic is encrypted and hidden, Jamf Trust cannot calculate traffic volume or usage time. This leads to <strong>anomalous usage data (showing as zero or very low)</strong> on official reports, which affects school KPI evaluations.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Does this Invade Privacy?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No.</strong> Disabling Private Relay simply means traffic does not go through Apple’s dual-encryption tunnel; it returns to standard network transmission.</li>\n<li>The school’s MDM and filtering mechanisms follow strict cybersecurity regulations. They only block harmful sites and track “usage hours.” Administrators cannot see specific Google search keywords or private messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Practical Advice:</h2>\n<p>If you find a student iPad that <strong>can enable</strong> Private Relay, it means the device has likely <strong>fallen out of management</strong> or <strong>missed the restriction profile.</strong> Ensure you run “Update Inventory” or redeploy the restriction settings in Jamf Pro for that device.</p>\n",

Power Issues</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No Power</strong>: Typically a motherboard power management IC or CPU rail failure.</li>\n<li><strong>Charging Failure</strong>: Aging battery modules, charging IC damage, or physical wear inside the Lightning port.</li>\n<li><strong>Battery Swelling</strong>: The screen is physically pushing away from the frame. This is a safety risk—report immediately.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Display and Connectivity</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Screen Lines</strong>: LCD ribbon cable aging, causing static lines or flickering.</li>\n<li><strong>Functional Failure</strong>: Wi-Fi toggle grayed out, Bluetooth failure, or gyroscope (accelerometer) damage preventing screen rotation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Warranty and Replacement Rights:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Non-Accidental Damage</strong>: As long as the device is physically intact (no cracked screen, no bent frame, no major impact dents), these failures are usually classified as “Natural Hardware Failure” and are covered by the warranty and maintenance contract.</li>\n<li><strong>Act Fast</strong>: If you find these issues, contact us immediately.

          "answer": "<p><strong>Digital Initiative iPads are permanent school assets. We strongly recommend continuing to manage them via MDM to maintain device security, instructional quality, and asset integrity.</strong></p>\n<h2>Why keep the MDM?</h2>\n<h3>1. Security</h3>\n<p>Continued web filtering protects students from inappropriate content, and MDM-enforced restrictions prevent the installation of games or unauthorized apps.</p>\n<h3>2. Instructional Continuity</h3>\n<p>Maintain the ability to push apps, manage Wi-Fi settings, and support Apple Classroom.</p>\n<h3>3. Asset Integrity</h3>\n<p>MDM tracking helps locate misplaced devices and monitors battery health, ensuring the hardware lasts as long as possible.</p>\n<h2>Recommended Strategies for 2026 and Beyond:</h2>\n<h3>1. Unified Health Checks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Battery Health</strong>: Identify units needing battery replacement before they become unusable.</li>\n<li><strong>OS Updates</strong>: Evaluate if the entire fleet should move to <strong>iOS 26</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Audit</strong>: Record physical damage and update the school’s overall asset registry.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2.

Granular Filtering</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Past</strong>: Could only block a domain (e.g., <code>example.com</code>). All pages on that site were treated the same.</li>\n<li><strong>New API</strong>: Can identify full URL paths (e.g., <code>example.com/bad-content</code>). This allows a school to block a specific inappropriate page while leaving the rest of the educational domain accessible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Privacy-First Design</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>On-Device Processing</strong>: Most filtering decisions happen locally on the device using a Bloom Filter, meaning private browsing history isn’t sent to a cloud server.</li>\n<li><strong>Private Information Retrieval (PIR)</strong>: When a cloud check is needed, it uses PIR technology so the server cannot see exactly which URL was queried.</li>\n<li><strong>Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP)</strong>: Queries are anonymized through a relay, ensuring neither Apple nor the provider can link a query to a specific student ID.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Performance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrated at the system level for faster processing and minimal impact on battery life.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Practical Advice for Schools</h2>\n<p>If you use a service like <strong>Jamf Trust</strong>, the transition to this new API is typically handled automatically by the provider. IT administrators usually don’t need to manually change settings. However, we recommend:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Testing</strong>: When upgrading a classroom to iOS 26, verify that your regional teaching platforms (educational portals) remain accessible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Battery Monitoring</strong>: Observe if the newer API reduces “battery drain” complaints from students, as this is a common side effect of older VPN-based filters.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

          "question": "Will the iOS 26 'Background Security Improvements' install automatically? Should I leave it on or off?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>The ‘Background Security Improvements’ feature in iOS 26 automatically installs critical security patches at appropriate times. We strongly recommend that schools keep this feature ON to ensure devices maintain a baseline of security protection.</strong></p>\n<h2>What are Background Security Improvements?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Goal</strong>: Rapidly patch major security vulnerabilities (especially in Safari and system frameworks) without requiring a full OS update or a device reboot.</li>\n<li><strong>Evolution</strong>: This is an evolution of the “Rapid Security Response” (RSR) technology.</li>\n<li><strong>Execution</strong>: Updates are small (tens of megabytes) and install silently when the device is idle and charging. In most cases, a restart is not required.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why it matters for Schools</h2>\n<h3>1. Reduces IT Burden</h3>\n<p>Managing hundreds of iPads across different classrooms is difficult. Background patching ensures devices are safe even if school IT doesn’t have time to perform a “Mass OS Update” that week.</p>\n<h3>2. Teaching Continuity</h3>\n<p>Standard system updates take 30–60 minutes and render the device unusable. These background patches happen after hours or during charging, ensuring no disruption to lesson time.</p>\n<h3>3. Zero-Day Protection</h3>\n<p>Schools are often targets for network-based exploits. These silent patches ensure students are protected as soon as a fix is released.</p>\n<h2>Management Advice</h2>\n<h3>Recommendation: Leave it ON</h3>\n<p>For the vast majority of schools, the default behavior (ON) is best. It provides a “Set it and forget it” security layer that requires zero manual labor from the staff.</p>\n<h3>Exception: When to Turn it OFF</h3>\n<p>If your school uses highly customized, proprietary teaching apps that are extremely sensitive to system changes, you can disable this via MDM:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>MDM Restriction</strong>: Disable the “Allow Background Security Improvements” toggle in your Restrictions payload.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you do this, you assume the risk of leaving your fleet exposed to known exploits until you perform a manual full system update.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Practical Tip:</h2>\n<p>Check the status in <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</strong>. If you see a small ‘letter’ next to the version (e.g., iOS 26.1 (a)), it means a background security patch is active. If a specific app starts behaving strangely after a patch, you can remove a background repair in the “About” section, though this should rarely be necessary.</p>\n",

          "question": "Integration Recommendations for New iPads (M4/A17 Pro) in the Digital Learning Project (2024–2026)",
          "answer": "<p><strong>Many schools have purchased newer iPad models (e.g., M4 iPad Pro, M2 iPad Air, iPad mini 7) during the project period (2022–2026) due to class expansion, hardware failure, or specific requirements. These newer models have significant hardware differences compared to the base iPad 9 used in the primary project fleet. Mixed management requires attention to accessory compatibility, charging logistics, and MDM configurations.</strong></p>\n<h2>Key Integration Considerations</h2>\n<h3>1. Accessory Compatibility (The Apple Pencil Gap)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Conflict</strong>: The Apple Pencil (1st Gen) and (2nd Gen) used with older project devices are <strong>not compatible</strong> with the M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air.</li>\n<li><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Ensure that procurement for new M4/M2 units includes the <strong>Apple Pencil Pro</strong> or <strong>Apple Pencil (USB-C)</strong>. Label these styluses clearly to prevent students from trying to pair the wrong pencil with the wrong iPad.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Charging and Power Logistics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Conflict</strong>: Older iPad 9 units use Lightning cables (USB-A to Lightning), while all new models (A17 Pro / M-series) use <strong>USB-C</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Infrastructure Impact</strong>: Existing charging carts may need cable replacements. We recommend “Hybrid Carts” where specifically marked slots are equipped with USB-C cables for the newer high-performance units.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. High-Performance Features in MDM</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Conflict</strong>: New M-series iPads support features like <strong>External Display Support (Stage Manager)</strong> and <strong>Windowed Apps (iPadOS 26)</strong> that the iPad 9 does not.</li>\n<li><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Use <strong>Smart Groups</strong> in Jamf Pro to move M-series iPads into a “High-Performance Group.” Enable Stage Manager and Windowed Apps for these students to allow for more advanced creative projects while keeping the standard iPad 9 fleet on a simplified single-app interface.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. Apple Intelligence Management</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Conflict</strong>: Only the newer M-series and A17 Pro iPads support <strong>Apple Intelligence</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Schools must decide on the AI policy specifically for these newer units (e.g., enabling Writing Tools for advanced students while disabling it during exams). Use MDM Restrictions to target only these “AI-capable” models.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Expert Advice</h2>\n<p>When managing a mixed fleet, labeling is your best friend. Use laser engraving or color-coded protective cases to distinguish between “Standard Project iPads” (iPad 9) and “High-Performance Creative iPads” (M-series). This helps teachers quickly identify which students have access to the newer iPadOS 26 pro features.</p>\n",

          "question": "How to use the iOS 26 'Background Security Improvements' to maintain security for project devices.",
          "answer": "<p><strong>For network administrators managing a large fleet of project devices, the biggest security risk is ‘unpatched systems’ due to users ignoring update prompts. iOS 26 introduces the ‘Background Security Improvements’ framework, allowing critical security patches to be installed automatically without a device reboot or disruption to teaching activities.</strong></p>\n<h2>Implementation for School Fleets</h2>\n<h3>1. Zero-Touch Security</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlike standard OS updates that require 30–60 minutes and a restart, Background Security Improvements are tiny patches (often involving Safar or system libraries).</li>\n<li><strong>Result</strong>: The device remains secure against the latest exploits even if the student never manually clicks “Update.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. MDM Configuration</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We recommend keeping the <strong>“Allow Background Security Improvements”</strong> restriction enabled (ON) in your global MDM profile.</li>\n<li>By default, this feature is ON in iOS 26. Unless your school has a specific compatibility reason to delay these (virtually non-existent for educational apps), leaving it on ensures the best protection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Monitoring via DDM</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In macOS/iOS 26, you can use the <strong>DDM Status Channel</strong> to see which devices have successfully applied these background patches.</li>\n<li>This provides a much cleaner audit trail for the Ministry of Education or school board to verify that 100% of the active fleet has mitigated a specific high-profile security vulnerability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Practical Tip for Teachers</h2>\n<p>Explain to students that if they see a small ‘letter’ next to their iPad version (e.g., iPadOS 26.1 (b)), it means their iPad has automatically protected itself from a security threat overnight while it was charging. This is an excellent opportunity for a brief ‘Digital Citizenship’ lesson on the importance of staying updated.</p>\n",
