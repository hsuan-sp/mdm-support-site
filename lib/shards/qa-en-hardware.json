          "question": "We have both older Lightning iPads and newer USB-C models. How do we manage accessories and Apple Pencils?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>As your school transitions to newer hardware, managing a mixed fleet of Lightning (iPad 9 and older) and USB-C (iPad 10 and newer) devices requires careful planning regarding peripherals and charging infrastructure.</strong></p>\n<h2>Apple Pencil Compatibility:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>iPad 9 (Lightning)</strong>: Only compatible with <strong>Apple Pencil (1st Generation)</strong>. It pairs by plugging the pencil directly into the iPad’s Lightning port.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>iPad 10 (USB-C Base Model)</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Using 1st Gen Pencil</strong>: Requires the <strong>“USB-C to Apple Pencil Adapter.”</strong> Because this adapter is small and easily lost, we recommend teachers manage these centrally.</li>\n<li><strong>Using USB-C Pencil</strong>: Pairs via a USB-C cable. Note that this model <em>does not</em> support pressure sensitivity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>iPad Pro/Air (M-series Chips)</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Major Change</strong>: These high-end models use a different magnetic structure and <strong>do not support Apple Pencil (2nd Gen)</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Compatible</strong>: Only <strong>Apple Pencil Pro</strong> (recommended for “Find My” support) or <strong>Apple Pencil (USB-C)</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Charging Cart &amp; Cable Management:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Zoning the Cart</strong>: We strongly recommend “Hard-wiring” regions of your charging carts. For example, dedicate slots 1-15 for Lightning cables (Year 5) and slots 16-30 for USB-C cables (Year 6). Use clear external labels to guide students.</li>\n<li><strong>Cable Quality</strong>: USB-C carries higher power and uses complex protocols. Ensure you use certified, high-quality cables. Poor-quality cables are the leading cause of “ghost touching” and charging IC failures in classroom environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid Adapters</strong>: Do not use small “Lightning to USB-C” dongles inside a charging cart. Students often snap these off inside the iPad’s port, leading to expensive repairs. Replacing the entire cable is a much more durable long-term solution.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Institutional Advice:</h2>\n<p>Maintain a “Hardware Mapping Table” that matches device serial numbers to specific peripherals. When upgrading hardware, evaluate the total cost of ownership, including the required new adapters or Pencils.</p>\n",

          "question": "An iPad isn't charging inside the cart. Is the device faulty or the cart?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>When an iPad fails to charge, we recommend a “Systematic Cross-Testing” approach to isolate the failure point between the device, the cable, and the cart’s power module.</strong></p>\n<h2>Cross-Testing Workflow:</h2>\n<h3>Stage 1: Slot and Cable Test</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Move the non-charging iPad to a <strong>known working slot</strong> in the cart (one that successfully charged another iPad).</li>\n<li>Wait 30 seconds. Does the “Lightning bolt” icon appear in the status bar?\n<ul>\n<li>✅ <strong>If it charges</strong>: The original cable or the power brick for that specific slot is likely faulty.</li>\n<li>❌ <strong>If it still doesn’t charge</strong>: Move to Stage 2.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Stage 2: Independent Power Test</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Remove the iPad from the cart and use a <strong>trusted standalone 20W charger</strong> and cable (direct to a wall outlet).</li>\n<li>Connect it directly to a wall power outlet.\n<ul>\n<li>✅ <strong>If it charges</strong>: The issue is with the cart’s internal power distribution or a tripped breaker.</li>\n<li>❌ <strong>If it still doesn’t charge</strong>: The issue is almost certainly a <strong>hardware failure on the iPad</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Stage 3: Physical Inspection</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Port Check</strong>: Use a flashlight to inspect the Lightning or USB-C port for lint, dust, or student-inserted debris. Carefully clear it using a non-conductive tool (like a wooden toothpick) or compressed air.</li>\n<li><strong>Deep Discharge</strong>: If an iPad has been dead for months, the battery voltage may be critically low. Keep it plugged into a high-wattage wall charger for at least <strong>60 minutes</strong> before declaring it a hardware failure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Institutional Advice:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Warranty</strong>: If the device is found to be faulty (e.g., a burned-out charging IC), verify its warranty status before sending it for repair.</li>\n<li><strong>Spare Parts</strong>: Cables are consumables. IT departments should keep a 5-10% stock of spare cables to quickly swap out damaged ones in classroom carts.</li>\n</ul>\n",

          "question": "AirDrop won't find other devices, or AirPlay can't see the classroom Apple TV. Why?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>AirDrop and AirPlay operate differently: AirDrop uses Peer-to-Peer communication, while AirPlay relies heavily on your campus network configuration.</strong></p>\n<h2>AirDrop Troubleshooting (Point-to-Point):</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Interface State</strong>: AirDrop requires both Bluetooth (for discovery) and Wi-Fi (for transfer). Even if there is no internet, Wi-Fi must be toggled ON.</li>\n<li><strong>Privacy Settings</strong>: Since iOS 16.2, “Everyone” mode automatically reverts to “Contacts Only” after 10 minutes. Ensure the recipient has manually re-enabled “Everyone” for the transfer.</li>\n<li><strong>Physical Interference</strong>: In crowded classrooms with many devices, Bluetooth discovery can be inconsistent. Ensure devices are within 3 meters and have a clear line of sight.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>AirPlay Troubleshooting (Network-Based):</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>VLAN Consistency</strong>: This is the most common campus issue. If a teacher’s iPad is on the <code>Staff-Wi-Fi</code> network but the Apple TV is on the <code>Student-IoT</code> network, and those networks are isolated, AirPlay packets cannot find their destination.</li>\n<li><strong>Multicast/mDNS Filtering</strong>: AirPlay uses the <strong>Bonjour (mDNS)</strong> protocol on UDP port 5353. If the school’s wireless access points have “Client Isolation” enabled, or if the firewall blocks Multicast traffic, the Apple TV won’t appear in the list.</li>\n<li><strong>Network Optimization (mDNS Gateway)</strong>: For complex campus networks with multiple VLANs, IT should enable an <strong>mDNS Gateway (or Bonjour Proxy)</strong> on the core switch or firewall. This allows discovery packets to “jump” across different network segments.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Institutional Advice:</h2>\n<p>If AirPlay issues occur frequently in specific rooms, check the wireless load. When an Access Point (AP) is overloaded with 40+ devices, it will often drop low-priority mDNS discovery packets first, causing the “list of TVs” to appear empty.</p>\n",

          "question": "How should we store iPads during the summer break to prevent battery damage?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>To protect the long-term health of your iPad’s lithium-ion battery during extended breaks, you should follow the “50% Power + Full Shutdown” rule.</strong> Storing a device improperly for 2-3 months can lead to “Deep Discharge,” where the battery becomes chemically unable to hold a charge ever again.</p>\n<h2>The Three Golden Rules for Storage:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Charge to ~50%</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do not store at 0%</strong>: This can lead to the battery falling into a deep discharge state, making the device impossible to turn on come September.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not store at 100%</strong>: Keeping a battery at maximum capacity for months can cause it to lose some of its total lifespan permanently.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Power Off Completely</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>After reaching 50%, go to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Shut Down</strong>. This ensures the device isn’t slowly draining power while sitting in the cart.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cool, Dry Environment</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Store the iPads (and the charging cart) in a temperature-controlled room. Excessive heat (like a non-air-conditioned classroom in the height of summer) accelerated chemical degradation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Operational Advice for IT:</h2>\n<p>Before the final day of the term, send a message to all students/teachers asking them to leave their devices at ~50% charge before handing them in.

          "question": "How do I handle 'Ghost Touch' or issues with auto-rotation on the screen?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>‘Ghost Touch’ (erratic touch input) typically involves Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) or a damaged digitizer layer. Auto-rotation issues are usually related to hardware failure of internal sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope).</strong> These issues directly impact the usability of the device. Administrators should distinguish between software settings, environmental interference, and pure hardware failure before deciding on a repair.</p>\n<h2>Part 1: Troubleshooting Ghost Touch</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Eliminate Electrical Noise and EMI</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Common Cause</strong>: Using non-original cables or unstable charging carts can generate “ripple noise” that interferes with the screen’s capacitive sensor, causing erratic touches.</li>\n<li><strong>The Big Test</strong>: <strong>Unplug all charging cables.</strong> If touch returns to normal while running strictly on battery, the problem lies with the charging equipment (cables or the PDU module in the cart). Switch to MFi-certified cables or inspect the cart.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Physical Cleaning and Pressure Check</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cleaning</strong>: Ensure the screen edges are free from sweat, oils, or liquid seepage.</li>\n<li><strong>Case Pressure</strong>: Check if a rugged case is too tight or if a screen protector is damaged at the edges, as this can transmit constant “false” pressure signals to the digitizer.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hard Reset</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPad 9th Gen (with Home Button)</strong>: Press and hold the Top button and the Home button until the Apple logo appears.</li>\n<li><strong>iPad 10th Gen (no Home Button)</strong>: Press and release Volume Up, press and release Volume Down, then press and hold the Top button until the logo appears.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Part 2: Determining Sensor Hardware Failure (Rotation)</h2>\n<p>If the iPad screen won’t rotate with the device, check the following in order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Control Center Lock</strong>: Ensure the “Rotation Lock” icon (a lock with a circular arrow) is not highlighted in red.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>MDM Restriction Check</strong>: Admins should verify that a <strong>Restrictions</strong> profile in Jamf Pro hasn’t accidentally enabled “Lock Screen Orientation,” which would disable rotation for all scoped devices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sensor Self-Diagnosis</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Logic</strong>: Rotation relies on the internal <strong>Accelerometer</strong> and <strong>Gyroscope</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Test Method</strong>: Open the built-in <strong>Compass</strong> app. If the needle is completely frozen, or the level feature doesn’t react to tilt, the internal sensor hardware is likely damaged.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Practical Advice: Repair Strategy</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>When to Repair</strong>: If Ghost Touch persists after removing external power and cleaning, or if the Compass app is unresponsive, it typically indicates a damaged <strong>digitizer layer</strong> or <strong>logic board sensor</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Contract Coverage</strong>: Provided there is no obvious physical damage or screen cracks, these issues are generally considered natural hardware failures. Contact support immediately to facilitate repair or replacement under your project’s warranty.</li>\n</ul>\n",

          "answer": "<p><strong>Yes, Apple explicitly allows the use of specific alcohol concentrations to clean iPads. According to the latest official guidelines, you can use 70% Isopropyl Alcohol, 75% Ethyl Alcohol, or disinfectant wipes on the hard, non-porous surfaces of the device.</strong></p>\n<p>In a classroom environment with multiple users, a proper disinfection routine is essential. Here is the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) based on Apple’s recommendations:</p>\n<h2>1. Approved Cleaning Agents:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>70% Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) wipes</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>75% Ethyl Alcohol wipes</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Clorox Disinfecting Wipes</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>A soft, lint-free microfiber cloth dampened with water</strong> (for basic cleaning only).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. Prohibited Substances &amp; Tools:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>❌ <strong>Bleach</strong> or products containing <strong>Hydrogen Peroxide</strong>.</li>\n<li>❌ <strong>Window cleaners or household detergents</strong>.</li>\n<li>❌ <strong>Aerosols, solvents, or abrasives</strong>.</li>\n<li>❌ <strong>Compressed air</strong> sprayed directly into openings (can damage microphone or speaker membranes).</li>\n<li>❌ <strong>Rough fabrics, paper towels, or napkins</strong> (may cause micro-scratches).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3. Standard Cleaning Steps:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Power Down</strong>: Unplug all external power, accessories, and cables, and turn off the iPad.</li>\n<li><strong>Spray the Cloth</strong>: <strong>Never spray cleaners directly onto the iPad.</strong> Spray the alcohol onto a soft, lint-free microfiber cloth until it is “slightly damp.”</li>\n<li><strong>Wipe Gently</strong>: Avoid excessive wiping, which may cause damage. Avoid any openings (such as the charging port, speakers, or microphone holes) to prevent liquid from entering the interior.</li>\n<li><strong>Accessory Cleaning</strong>: The body of an Apple Pencil (USB-C) can be wiped with a dampened cloth, but <strong>do not wipe the tip itself or allow liquid to enter the USB-C connector.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>4. Risk Warnings and Material Differences:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Oleophobic Coating</strong>: iPad screens have an oil-resistant coating that naturally wears over time. While alcohol is allowed, frequent or excessive cleaning will accelerate the degradation of this coating.</li>\n<li><strong>Nano-texture Models (Special Note)</strong>: If your iPad Pro (M4) is equipped with <strong>Nano-texture glass</strong>, only use the dedicated polishing cloth provided by Apple. For stubborn grime, you may dampen the cloth with 70% IPA.</li>\n<li><strong>Leather and Fabric Accessories</strong>: <strong>Stay away</strong> from alcohol on official Apple leather, FineWoven, or Smart Folio fabrics, as it will cause discoloration or material damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Practical Advice:</h2>\n<p>For school-wide management, we recommend placing a dedicated microfiber cloth in each charging cart and having teachers manage the alcohol spray to ensure students don’t spray liquid directly into the devices, which could cause internal hardware damage (liquid damage is not covered under Apple’s standard warranty).</p>\n",

          "answer": "<p><strong>Keyboard failures typically stem from model incompatibility, oxidized contacts, or physical misalignment of the magnets. Since original Apple keyboards do not require Bluetooth pairing, if cleaning doesn’t work, it usually involves a hardware circuit failure.</strong></p>\n<p>In a 2026 classroom environment where iPad 9th, 10th, and 11th generations coexist, the keyboard structures are not always interchangeable. Follow these professional steps to troubleshoot:</p>\n<h2>Phase 1: Verify Physical Compatibility (Core Check)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPad 9th Gen</strong>: Only supports the <strong>Smart Keyboard</strong> using a Lightning-based connector on the vertical side.</li>\n<li><strong>iPad 10th / 11th Gen</strong>: Only supports the two-piece <strong>Magic Keyboard Folio</strong>, which uses Smart Connector pins on the horizontal side.</li>\n<li><strong>Warning</strong>: Forcing an iPad 9th Gen keyboard onto a newer model will not work; the magnets and electronic protocols are fundamentally different.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Phase 2: Deep Cleaning the Smart Connector</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Inspect Contacts</strong>: Locate the three circular metal pins on the iPad (either side or back) and the corresponding pins on the keyboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Remove Oxidation</strong>: Use a <strong>70% Isopropyl Alcohol wipe</strong> to gently clean the metal contacts. If there is visible discoloration, you can use a clean pencil eraser to gently rub the metal surface, then wipe clean with a microfiber cloth.</li>\n<li><strong>Remove Debris</strong>: Ensure no metallic debris (like staple bits or pencil lead shavings) is stuck in the magnetic channel, which could cause a short circuit or poor contact.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Phase 3: Installation and Software Check</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Reseat</strong>: Completely remove the iPad from the keyboard case and reinstall it. For the Magic Keyboard Folio, ensure both the back panel and keyboard are properly aligned.</li>\n<li><strong>Remove Interference</strong>: Some third-party cases or extra-thick screen protectors may prevent the Smart Connector from making a solid connection.

          "answer": "<p><strong>Unlike the iPhone, no current iPad models (including the iPad 9th, 10th, and 11th generations) have an ‘externally visible’ Liquid Contact Indicator (LCI).</strong> Moisture determination is made by authorized technicians after disassembling the device to inspect internal indicators.</p>\n<h2>How Service Centers Determine Liquid Damage:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Internal LCI Inspection</strong>: During a <strong>Visual Mechanical Inspection (VMI)</strong> at an Apple Authorized Service Provider (AASP), technicians check LCI stickers placed on the logic board or near critical flex cables. If the sticker has turned <strong>red</strong> due to liquid contact, the device is classified as having liquid damage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>External Secondary Indicators (Corrosion)</strong>: Even if internal stickers aren’t visible, technicians look for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>White powder or green corrosion on the charging port (Lightning/USB-C) or speaker meshes.</li>\n<li>Liquid residue or “water spots” behind the screen assembly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Warranty Impact</strong>: Liquid damage is not covered under the standard Apple one-year limited warranty. In most maintenance contracts, it is treated as accidental damage caused by the user.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Disposal</strong>: If localized repair is impossible, a “Paid Whole Unit Replacement” is required, typically costing around <strong>NT$10,200</strong> (subject to actual quote).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Practical Advice &amp; Prevention:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Storage Environment</strong>: Avoid storing devices near water dispensers or in unventilated, high-humidity warehouses during breaks. Long-term exposure to extreme humidity can trigger internal LCIs even without direct liquid spills.</li>\n<li><strong>Cleaning Risks</strong>: <strong>Never spray cleaning liquids directly</strong> onto the iPad screen or into any openings. Capillary action can pull liquid inside, leading to a “liquid damage” diagnosis during repair.</li>\n<li><strong>Pre-submission Check</strong>: If an iPad fails to charge, visually inspect the port for discoloration or debris. Be honest when describing the issue to the service center to avoid disputes over repair quotes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Practical Advice: Summary</h2>\n<p>Since the determination lies entirely with the service center’s internal inspection, report observed symptoms truthfully to avoid controversies arising from concealing moisture issues.</p>\n",

          "answer": "<p><strong>iPad performance is a balance between battery health, software demands, and hardware degradation. As a device enters its 4th or 5th year, multiple factors combine to cause noticeable lag.</strong></p>\n<p>For project devices (like iPad 9) showing lag in late 2025, assess using these dimensions:</p>\n<h2>1. Power Management Throttling:</h2>\n<p>When a lithium battery’s ability to provide peak power declines, iPadOS limits the CPU/GPU speed to prevent unexpected shutdowns during high-load tasks (like AR or video editing).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Apps take longer to launch, scrolling stutters, and keyboard input lags.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Status</strong>: If cycle count is high, the system may throttle performance for stability even if the charge percentage looks full.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. Software Resource Evolution (Software Bloat):</h2>\n<p>Modern versions of iPadOS (OS 18/26) and teaching apps require significantly more RAM (Random Access Memory) than they did four years ago.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hardware Bottleneck</strong>: Base models with only 3GB of RAM (like iPad 9) frequently perform “Memory Swapping” when handling complex web content, which creates a “stuck” feeling for the user.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3. Physical Hardware Decay:</h2>\n<p>Besides the battery, internal <strong>NAND Flash storage</strong> has a finite number of write cycles. After thousands of read/write operations, latency increases. Additionally, motherboard components degrade over time under constant thermal cycles. This is irreversible physical aging.</p>\n<h2>Recommended Troubleshooting Steps:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Clear System Cache</strong>: Go to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; iPad Storage</strong>. Ensure free space is greater than 10GB.</li>\n<li><strong>Hard Restart</strong>: Helps free up residual memory resources.</li>\n<li><strong>Evaluate Replacement</strong>: If running basic learning platforms or making slides feels significantly slow, the hardware spec may no longer support modern teaching needs.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Practical Advice:</h2>\n<p>For iPads that have served over 4 years, schools should plan a “Tier 2” or “Retirement” program (e.g., repurposing them as library kiosks or admin-only single-app devices) and purchase new models with higher RAM and A/M series chips to maintain teaching quality.</p>\n",

          "answer": "<p><strong>This is usually not a hardware failure! The ‘Liquid Glass’ design language introduced in iOS 26 uses heavy ‘Frosted Glass’ and ‘Depth of Field’ effects that can be mistaken for a foggy or defective screen.</strong></p>\n<h2>How to tell if it’s a design effect:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Screenshot Test</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have the student take a screenshot (Power + Volume Up).</li>\n<li>View the screenshot in the Photos app. If the image is sharp but the screen physically looks blurry ➡️ <strong>Hardware failure (NAND/Panel)</strong>.</li>\n<li>If the image inside the screenshot is blurry (e.g., the Lock Screen background) ➡️ <strong>Software effect</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Check Liquid Glass Settings</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Display &amp; Brightness &gt; Appearance</strong>.</li>\n<li>Check the <strong>“Liquid Glass Transparency”</strong> setting. If set too high, backgrounds will be extremely blurred.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How to Resolve:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Case A: Software Intent (Normal)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explain to the student that this is the new iOS 26 style (similar to visionOS).</li>\n<li>If it impacts readability, go to <strong>Accessibility &gt; Display &amp; Text Size</strong> and turn on <strong>Reduce Transparency</strong>. This disables the Liquid Glass effect and returns to solid backgrounds.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Case B: Hardware Failure</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the screenshot is sharp but the physical view is blurry, and a restart doesn’t fix it, the screen coating may be delaminating or the panel may be failing. Report for repair!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Defensive Management:</h2>\n<p>When upgrading to <strong>iOS 26</strong>, spend 2 minutes during homeroom explaining that “Looking a bit blurry on the Lock Screen is the new style.” This will prevent a flood of false repair reports.</p>\n",
