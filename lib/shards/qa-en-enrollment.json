          "question": "My new iPad didn't show the 'Remote Management' screen during setup. How do I fix this?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>If your iPad goes straight to the standard personal setup screens instead of the school’s “Remote Management” prompt, it usually means the device serial number hasn’t been linked to your MDM server by Apple.</strong></p>\n<p>This automated process—known as <strong>Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)</strong>—relies on the device “checking in” with Apple’s servers the moment it connects to Wi-Fi. If no assignment is found, Apple treats it as a private retail device.</p>\n<h2>Troubleshooting Steps:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Verify Status in Apple School Manager (ASM)</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to <a href=\"https://school.apple.com\">school.apple.com</a>.</li>\n<li>Search for the serial number under <strong>“Devices.”</strong></li>\n<li>Check the <strong>“MDM Server”</strong> field. If it’s blank, you need to manually assign it to your Jamf Pro server.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Check with your Reseller</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the serial number is not found in ASM at all, your authorized Apple reseller hasn’t uploaded the purchase record yet. Large orders during the back-to-school season can occasionally cause a delay of a few business days. Contact your vendor with the Purchase Order (PO) number to expedite the sync.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Audit Jamf Pro PreStage Scope</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure the device is included in the <strong>“Scope”</strong> of your active PreStage Enrollment profile in Jamf Pro. We recommend setting your primary PreStage as the <strong>“Default”</strong> so new assignments are captured automatically.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Network Requirements</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The device must be on a Wi-Fi network that allows traffic to Apple’s activation servers (and doesn’t block APNs) to trigger the setup.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How to Relink the Device:</h2>\n<p>If the device has already reached the Home Screen (skipping management):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The device must be erased</strong>: Go to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Transfer or Reset iPad &gt; Erase All Content and Settings</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once wiped and restarted, ensure the Wi-Fi connection is stable. The device will check again and should now present the “Remote Management” screen.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

          "answer": "<p><strong>Yes, you can, but manual enrollment (User-Initiated) provides significantly less administrative control compared to Automated Device Enrollment (ADE).</strong></p>\n<p>Manual enrollment is typically reserved for personal “Bring Your Own Device” (BYOD) scenarios or donated legacy hardware that cannot be added to Apple School Manager (ASM).</p>\n<h2>Key Differences:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Management Authority</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Automated (ADE)</strong>: Devices are placed in <strong>“Supervised Mode”</strong> by default. This grants the school the highest level of authority, enabling features like silent app updates, forcing restrictions (kiosk mode), and preventing the removal of the management profile.</li>\n<li><strong>Manual</strong>: Devices are “Unsupervised.” The school has limited control and cannot force certain high-level restrictions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Removal Rights</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Automated (ADE)</strong>: The school can make the management profile <strong>“Non-Removable.”</strong> The student cannot delete the profile from settings.</li>\n<li><strong>Manual</strong>: The user can delete the management profile at any time via <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; VPN &amp; Device Management</strong>, instantly disconnecting the device from the school’s control.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Modern Methods</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While old-fashioned manual enrollment required visiting a web URL in Safari, the modern approach is <strong>“Account-Driven Enrollment.”</strong> Users simply sign in with their Managed Apple Account in Settings, and the system automatically guides them through the enrollment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How to Upgrade Manual Devices to “Supervised” Status:</h2>\n<p>If you have a device that wasn’t bought through school channels but you want full control over it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Physical Link</strong>: Connect the iPad to a Mac running <strong>Apple Configurator</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Prepare</strong>: Use the “Prepare” wizard and select <strong>“Add to Apple School Manager.”</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wipe &amp; Bridge</strong>: This process <strong>will erase the device</strong>. Once completed, the device enters a 30-day “provisional period” during which the user can still opt-out.

          "answer": "<p><strong>This indicates a communication delay or interruption while the device attempts to fetch the MDM configuration profile from Apple’s servers.</strong></p>\n<p>It is usually related to the network environment or MDM server response. “Retrieving remote management configuration” is a key step in <strong>Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)</strong>. Ideally, it should complete within 30 seconds to 2 minutes. If it hangs for more than 5 minutes, proceed with the following checks:</p>\n<h2>Cause 1: Network Restrictions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Firewall Blocking</strong>: The school network might be blocking access to Apple’s device management hosts. Ensure traffic to <code>iprofiles.apple.com</code> and your MDM server URL is allowed.</li>\n<li><strong>Solution</strong>: Try connecting the iPad to a mobile hotspot (4G/5G). If it proceeds successfully, the issue lies with the campus firewall.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Cause 2: Jamf Pro Performance or Settings</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Server Latency</strong>: If hundreds of devices are enrolling simultaneously, Jamf Cloud might experience queuing delays.</li>\n<li><strong>Corrupt PreStage</strong>: Occasionally, a PreStage configuration can have logic errors.

          "answer": "<p><strong>When you configure ‘Install Apps’ in PreStage enrollment, the device waits for apps to download before allowing access to the Home Screen.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Any network issues or VPP license failures will cause a deadlock.</strong> This is extremely common during <strong>Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)</strong>. Admins often want students to see essential apps immediately upon boot, but if the environment isn’t perfect, it leads to disaster during mass deployments.</p>\n<h2>Core Causes:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Insufficient VPP Licenses or Invalid Token</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the assigned app has 0 remaining licenses, Apple servers cannot issue a download token, causing the device to wait indefinitely.</li>\n<li><strong>Solution</strong>: Check the “Volume Purchasing” status in Jamf Pro to ensure sufficient licenses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Campus Wi-Fi Saturation</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a class of 30 iPads tries to download a 2GB app (e.g., GarageBand) at the Setup screen simultaneously, the Wi-Fi bandwidth will collapse, leading to timeouts.</li>\n<li><strong>Solution</strong>: Avoid forcing large apps during PreStage.

To ensure the local name matches, successful admins use three correct methods:</p>\n<h2>1. Automatic Naming via ‘PreStage Enrollment’</h2>\n<p>This is the recommended automated solution, naming the device the moment it activates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Configure in <strong>PreStage Enrollment &gt; Mobile Device Names</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use Variables</strong>: You can use <code>$SERIALNUMBER</code> or <code>$ASSET_TAG</code> to generate names like <code>EDU-$SERIALNUMBER</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Critical Checkbox</strong>: You must check <strong>Enforce Mobile Device Name on devices</strong>. This ensures the device renames itself upon connecting to the network during setup.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. Manual Sync via ‘Remote Commands’</h2>\n<p>If you have already edited the name in the Jamf Pro device record, you must take the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Edit</strong> on the device record and confirm the name change.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check the box <strong>Enforce Mobile Device Name</strong> below the name field and save.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The system will immediately queue a <code>DeviceName</code> command to the iPad. Once the device receives it (must be unlocked and online), the local name will update.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3. Batch Updates using ‘Mass Actions’ or The MUT</h2>\n<p>When hundreds of devices need renaming:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mass Actions</strong>: Select specific devices in a Smart Group, then choose <strong>Action &gt; Send Remote Commands &gt; Set Device Name</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The MUT</strong>: Upload a CSV file containing “Serial Number” and “Desired Name”.

          "answer": "<p><strong>This is usually due to a ‘System Permission Conflict’ or specific ‘App Management Attributes.’ Check the following three areas in order:</strong></p>\n<h2>1. Distinguish between “Remove from Home Screen” and “Delete”</h2>\n<p>In recent versions of iPadOS, long-pressing an app brings up “Remove App.” Upon selection, the system asks to either “Delete App” or “Remove from Home Screen.” If the “Delete” option is missing, the function is locked.</p>\n<h2>2. Screen Time Interference</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Local Settings Priority</strong>: If a student has manually gone to <strong>Settings &gt; Screen Time &gt; Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions &gt; iTunes &amp; App Store Purchases</strong> and set “Deleting Apps” to “Don’t Allow,” this local setting will block the MDM policy.</li>\n<li><strong>Solution</strong>: Push a new “Restrictions” profile from Jamf Pro and ensure the relevant options are checked to forcibly override local restrictions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3. App-Specific Management Attributes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Non-Removable Apps</strong>: When deploying an app via Jamf Pro, check its settings. If “Make app non-removable” is checked, students cannot delete that specific app even if they have global deletion permissions.</li>\n<li><strong>Solution</strong>: Return to the App configuration in Jamf Pro and uncheck “Make app non-removable” if applicable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Troubleshooting Tips:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sync Issues</strong>: Sometimes devices don’t refresh permissions immediately. Try sending a <strong>Blank Push</strong> or <strong>Update Inventory</strong> command.</li>\n<li><strong>System Apps</strong>: Note that certain native Apple apps (e.g., Settings, App Store, Messages) cannot be deleted under any circumstances as part of the core system protection.</li>\n</ul>\n",

          "question": "What is 'Shared iPad'? How can students share devices and keep their data private?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>‘Shared iPad’ is an Apple feature designed for non-1:1 environments. It allows multiple students to sign in to the same iPad using their ‘Managed Apple Accounts’ while maintaining independent workspaces.</strong></p>\n<p>This solves the problem of student data (Safari history, projects, etc.) getting mixed up when sharing devices.</p>\n<h2>Core Requirements:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Managed Apple Accounts</strong>: This is mandatory. Students must use their school-issued accounts so the system can identify and sync their personal data.</li>\n<li><strong>Supervised Mode &amp; ADE</strong>: The device must be Supervised and enrolled via Automated Device Enrollment (ADE).</li>\n<li><strong>Storage Planning</strong>: The system divides the iPad’s internal storage into multiple “User Spaces.” For example, a 128GB iPad set for 10 users will pre-allocate a disk quota for each individual.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How to Configure (via Jamf Pro):</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Navigate</strong>: Go to <strong>Mobile Devices &gt; PreStage Enrollments</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enable</strong>: In your PreStage profile, find and check the <strong>Shared iPad</strong> option.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Set User Capacity</strong>: Define the <strong>Maximum Number of Users</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Storage Tip</strong>: While iPadOS supports “Dynamic Quota,” we recommend no more than 3 users for 64GB models. Larger models (128GB+) can accommodate more users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wipe and Re-enroll</strong>: If the device is not currently in Shared Mode, you <strong>must wipe the device</strong> and re-enroll it via the updated PreStage profile for the feature to take effect.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Pros and Cons:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Privacy</strong>: Once a student logs out, the next user cannot access their data.</li>\n<li><strong>Cloud Sync</strong>: Projects started on Device A will sync (via iCloud) when the student logs into Device B.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Login Time</strong>: The initial login requires downloading the user profile, which can take time on slower networks.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Storage</strong>: If too many users are assigned, students may run out of space when installing large apps or filming high-res video.</li>\n<li><strong>Guest Sessions</strong>: You can enable Temporary Sessions for account-free login, but all data is wiped immediately upon logout.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Practical Advice:</h2>\n<p>Shared iPad relies heavily on stable, high-speed campus Wi-Fi.

For devices not purchased through an authorized education reseller, you can use Apple Configurator to manually enroll them into your Apple School Manager (ASM) organization.</strong></p>\n<p>This allows “retail” iPads or Macs to achieve the same management status (Supervised) as those purchased through official channels.</p>\n<h2>Preparation:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Hardware</strong>: A Mac with <strong>Apple Configurator</strong> installed, or an iPhone with the <strong>Apple Configurator app</strong> (for adding Macs to ASM).</li>\n<li><strong>Permissions</strong>: An ASM account with “Device Enrollment Manager” or “Administrator” roles.</li>\n<li><strong>Device State</strong>: The iPad must be on the <strong>Setup Assistant</strong> (Hello) screen. If it is already in use, it must be erased first.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The 30-Day Provisional Period:</h2>\n<p>Devices added manually to ASM have a <strong>30-day “grace period”</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>User Rights</strong>: During these 30 days, a user can manually remove the MDM profile via the device Settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Permanent Enrollment</strong>: After 30 days, the device becomes a permanent part of the organization.

          "question": "The school is changing its Wi-Fi SSID. How do I prevent iPads from losing connectivity?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>This is a common maintenance task that frequently leads to mass disconnections. You must follow the ‘Parallel Deployment’ principle: Never delete the old setting until the new network is verified as functional.</strong></p>\n<p>If handled incorrectly, iPads will lose contact with the old Wi-Fi and be unable to receive the MDM command for the new Wi-Fi, leaving them as “unmanaged” devices that must be manually connected one by one.</p>\n<h2>Standard Safe Migration SOP:</h2>\n<h3>Step 1: Push the New Profile</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a new Wi-Fi configuration profile in Jamf Pro (with the new SSID and password).</li>\n<li>Deploy this to all devices. At this point, the iPads will have <em>both</em> the old and new Wi-Fi settings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step 2: Field Testing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Take a test iPad to various locations in the school. Manually turn off the old SSID (if broadcasting) to confirm the device switches to and successfully connects via the new SSID.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step 3: Grace Period</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep both SSIDs active for at least <strong>2 to 3 days</strong>.</li>\n<li>This ensures that devices that were asleep, powered off, or off-site have a chance to wake up and receive the new Wi-Fi profile before the old network disappears.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step 4: Decommission Old Config</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Once you verify that the majority of devices have connected via the new network (checked via inventory reports), remove the “Scope” for the old Wi-Fi profile in Jamf Pro.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>WARNING: Why you should NOT just edit the old profile</h2>\n<p>If you simply modify the existing Wi-Fi profile (changing SSID A to SSID B), the iPad will disconnect from A the moment it receives the command. If there is a typo in the password or the APs aren’t ready for B, the iPad is now offline and cannot receive the “correction” command you send later. This creates a dead loop.</p>\n<h2>Practical Advice:</h2>\n<p>Always perform the full workflow on a single “test classroom” before rolling it out to the entire school.</p>\n",

Prior to iOS 26, this required a full erase, which was a barrier for students with extensive learning data. iOS 26 solves this with ‘Zero-Wipe MDM Migration.’</strong></p>\n<h2>The Migration Workflow (SOP)</h2>\n<h3>1. Preparation in ASM/ABM</h3>\n<p>The MDM server change must originate at the root of the ownership chain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In <strong>Apple School Manager</strong>, go to <strong>Devices</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select the target devices and choose <strong>Edit MDM Server</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Point them to your new “In-House” MDM server.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Configure the Migration Payload</h3>\n<p>In your <em>existing</em> (MOE) MDM server, you must configure the migration instructions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Target MDM URL</strong>: The enrollment URL of your new server.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enforcement Deadline</strong>: Define the date and time when the transfer <em>must</em> occur.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. The Device Experience</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The student receives a notification that their device will be moved to a new management system.</li>\n<li>Up until the deadline, they can choose “Later.”</li>\n<li>At the <strong>Enforcement Deadline</strong>, the device silently unenrolls from the MOE server and immediately enrolls in the school’s server.</li>\n<li><strong>Crucial</strong>: All local student files, photos, and project data are <strong>not touched</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Risks and Mitigation for Schools</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>App Licensing</strong>: VPP app licenses belong to the MDM server. You must ensure you have enough VPP licenses in the <em>new</em> server for all apps. We recommend setting the new server as the license owner prior to migration.</li>\n<li><strong>Configuration Conflicts</strong>: If the old server had a “Restriction” that the new server doesn’t, those “ghost” restrictions might linger if not handled correctly. We recommend a “Cleanup” script run by the new MDM upon first check-in.</li>\n<li><strong>Teacher/Staff vs. Student</strong>: This feature is highly recommended for Teacher/Staff devices to avoid disrupting their administrative files. For student devices, if the storage is already cluttered, a traditional “Return to Service” (Wipe) remains the better option for long-term stability.</li>\n</ul>\n",
