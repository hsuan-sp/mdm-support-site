          "question": "The VPN icon is missing on iPadOS. Are network filtering and usage reporting still working?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>Yes, everything is working perfectly. In modern iPadOS versions (17 through 26), Jamf Trust uses “DNS Proxy” and “Content Filter” technology which does not require a VPN tunnel.</strong> This architectural shift is intentional and was implemented to improve device battery life and network stability across school campuses.</p>\n<h2>Why the Icon is Gone:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Legacy (iOS 16 &amp; older)</strong>: Used “Always-On VPN” which displayed a permanent VPN icon.</li>\n<li><strong>Modern (iOS 17 - 26)</strong>: Uses native <strong>Content Filtering APIs</strong>. These operate at the system level without needing a separate VPN connection, so the icon is no longer displayed in the status bar.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to Verify Protection is Active:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Open the Jamf Trust App</strong>: If it shows a <strong>Green Shield (Protected)</strong>, your data is being recorded and filtered correctly.</li>\n<li><strong>Test the Filter</strong>: Try navigating to a known blocked category (e.g., a gaming site) in Safari. If the page is blocked, the filter is active.</li>\n<li><strong>Check Jamf Pro</strong>: Reconfirm that the “DNS Proxy” and “Content Filter” profiles are marked as “Installed” in the device inventory.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>New for 2026: Return to Service (RTS) Protection</h2>\n<p>In macOS and <strong>iOS 26</strong>, these network filters are now protected by <strong>RTS (Return to Service)</strong>. Even if a device is erased, the management configuration is baked into the reactivation process, ensuring the device is “Born Protected” the moment it joins a network.</p>\n<h2>Institutional Advice:</h2>\n<p>Occasionally, the Jamf Trust app might show a red warning if a passcode is missing or the OS is out of date. While you should encourage students to update, <strong>these local warnings do not stop the usage statistics from being reported to the school dashboard.</strong></p>\n",

          "answer": "<p><strong>The best method depends on how much time you have between lessons. For the fastest handoff, use ‘Shared iPad’ mode or the ‘Return to Service’ remote command.</strong></p>\n<h2>Scenario A: Shared iPad Mode (Most Common)</h2>\n<p>If your iPads are configured as <strong>Shared iPads</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>End of Lesson</strong>: Student simply taps “Log Out.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Handoff</strong>: The iPad returns to the login screen.

          "question": "The iPad feels slow or laggy. Is it faulty? How do we fix it?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>Most ‘slowness’ is caused by software fatigue rather than hardware failure. Regular maintenance steps can restore the device to its original speed.</strong></p>\n<h2>Troubleshooting Checklist:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reboot (The Most Important Step)</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>iPads are often left on for weeks at a time. A simple <strong>Hard Restart</strong> clears out memory leaks and hung background processes. <strong>Tip</strong>: We recommend every student reboots their iPad once a week.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Storage Overload</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; iPad Storage</strong>. If the device has less than <strong>2GB</strong> of free space, iPadOS will slow down significantly as it struggles to manage temporary files. Ask the student to delete large personal videos or unused games.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Background Activity (Apple Intelligence)</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On newer iPads (M-series, iPadOS 18-26), the system may be indexing data for school-managed AI features. If the iPad is warm and slow after a major update, plug it into power and leave it on Wi-Fi overnight to finish the process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Browser Fatigue</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Students often have 50+ tabs open in Safari. Closing all tabs and clearing the history/metadata (<strong>Settings &gt; Safari &gt; Clear History</strong>) can instantly improve web-based learning performance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Operating System Version</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure the device is running the latest allowed version of iPadOS. Apple regularly releases patches that optimize performance for older hardware.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>When to contact the ICT Support Team:</h2>\n<p>If the device is still slow after a reboot and a storage cleanup, or if the screen is behaving erratically (ghost touching), it may have a failing digitizer or battery. At this point, the device should be sent to the ICT Support Team for a hardware diagnostic.</p>\n",

Prioritize the ‘Classroom’ App (Recommended)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Classroom</strong> app bypasses the AirDrop Code requirement entirely.</li>\n<li><strong>Action</strong>: Teachers should use the “Navigate” or “Share” function within the Classroom app to push PDFs and URLs. It’s faster, requires no student confirmation, and works for the whole class simultaneously.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. ‘Pairing Day’ Routine</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If your curriculum requires formats that Classroom doesn’t support (like large Keynote project files), dedicate 5 minutes at the start of the semester for “Pairing Day.”</li>\n<li>Have students pair with their neighbors using the AirDrop code once. This trust will last for 30 days.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Cloud Relay</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Upload the material to Google Drive or a school NAS and push the <em>link</em> via Classroom.

          "question": "Can iPads from the Digital Learning Project (MOE) still be used after the project expires? Is upgrading to iPadOS 26 safe?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>iPads provided by the Digital Learning Project are school assets. Even after the initial project period concludes, they can continue to be used as long as the school maintains them. Upgrading to iPadOS 26 is technically viable and highly recommended, provided you consider MDM server compatibility.</strong></p>\n<h2>Evaluation for the iPadOS 26 Upgrade</h2>\n<h3>1. Hardware Longevity</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The primary project device is the <strong>iPad (9th Gen, A13 chip)</strong>.</li>\n<li>Follow-on purchases may include the <strong>iPad (10th Gen, A14 chip)</strong> or the <strong>iPad (11th Gen, A16 chip)</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>All three models fully support iPadOS 26</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Note</strong>: While these models cannot run “Apple Intelligence” features due to hardware limitations, they still benefit from critical security updates and performance optimizations (like the improved Return to Service).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. MDM Compatibility</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Centralized Instance</strong>: If your devices are managed by the Ministry’s central <strong>Jamf Pro</strong>, verify that the central server has been updated to a version that supports iPadOS 26.</li>\n<li><strong>Self-Managed</strong>: If your school manages its own server (Mosyle, Intune, or a private Jamf instance), verify compatibility before a mass rollout.</li>\n<li><strong>Pilot Test</strong>: Always upgrade one test unit to iPadOS 26 first. Verify that app distribution, restriction profiles, and Wi-Fi certificates function as expected before upgrading the whole fleet.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Benefits of Upgrading</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Security</strong>: Access to iOS 26 “Background Security Improvements” and the latest patches.</li>\n<li><strong>Stability</strong>: Fixes for known Wi-Fi connectivity issues present in earlier versions (like iOS 18).</li>\n<li><strong>Support Cycle</strong>: Ensures the 2022–2023 fleet remains supported by modern educational apps through at least 2027.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Recommendations for Post-Project Use</h2>\n<p>We recommend maintaining your existing management framework to protect the learning environment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ownership</strong>: The device remains school property; management settings should remain identical to when it was in use during the project.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>App Guidelines</strong>: If the App Store is currently blocked, keep it blocked to prevent the device from becoming a gaming console at home.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Safety</strong>: Continue using your Content Filter (e.g., Jamf Safe Internet) to protect students from inappropriate content while using the device off-campus.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Summary Advice</h2>\n<p>As long as the hardware is healthy and your MDM server is up to date, upgrading to iPadOS 26 is the safest and most efficient way to extend the lifespan and educational value of your project investment.</p>\n",

          "answer": "<p><strong>Apple Intelligence’s ‘Writing Tools’ are powerful assistants, but they raise concerns about academic integrity during composition or language exams. Teachers can manage these through MDM restrictions or real-time monitoring via the Classroom app.</strong></p>\n<h2>Three Management Strategies</h2>\n<h3>1. Administrative Restrictions via MDM (Mandatory)</h3>\n<p>IT administrators can configure specific restrictions in the Jamf Pro profile:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Full Disable</strong>: Best for high-stakes exam periods.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Granular Block</strong>: Schools can choose to disable the “Rewrite” feature (preventing AI from writing the essay) while allowing the “Proofread” and “Summarize” features for daily learning support.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Managed Apple Account Compliance</strong>: On school-managed devices, Writing Tools data is processed with strict privacy protocols, ensuring student data is never used for model training.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Real-time Monitoring via ‘Classroom’ App</h3>\n<p>iOS 26 enhances a teacher’s visibility into the student’s activity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Screen View</strong>: Teachers can see in real-time if a student has the Writing Tools floating panel open on their screen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Class Summary</strong>: After a session ends, the “Class Summary” report can indicate which students utilized AI assistance during their writing time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Utilizing Assessment Mode</h3>\n<p>For formal testing, we recommend using <strong>‘Single App Mode’</strong>. In iOS 26, entering Single App Mode <strong>automatically suppresses</strong> system-level Apple Intelligence features, ensuring a clean and fair testing environment.</p>\n<h2>Pedagogical Recommendations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: If AI tools are permitted, require students to add a disclosure note at the end of their work (e.g., “This essay was proofread using Apple Intelligence”).</li>\n<li><strong>AI as a teaching tool</strong>: Use the multiple “Rewrite” versions generated by AI as a starting point for class discussions on rhetoric and tone.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>AI is a critical future skill. Rather than a permanent ban, we recommend teachers allow AI during the “Brainstorming” phase while restricting it via MDM during the “Formal Drafting” and “Assessment” phases.</p>\n",

          "answer": "<p><strong>Device retirement is more than just turning off the power. It involves data sanitization and the secure return of ownership rights in Apple School Manager (ASM). A proper retirement process ensures student privacy and meets ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) sustainability standards.</strong></p>\n<h2>Retirement SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)</h2>\n<h3>1. Secure Data Wipe (Zero-Touch Cleanup)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Execute Wipe</strong>: Send a remote wipe command via Jamf Pro. Use the <strong>“Erase All Content and Settings (EACS)”</strong> command for modern Macs and iPads; it is faster and more secure than a traditional re-installation.</li>\n<li><strong>Verification</strong>: Ensure the MDM console confirms the “Wipe Complete” status before physical disposal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Disassociation in ASM (Release from ASM)</h3>\n<p>This is the most critical step. It prevents the device from trying to enroll back in the school MDM if it is resold or recycled:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Log in to <strong>Apple School Manager</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Search for the serial number and select <strong>“Release Device.”</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: Once released, a device cannot be re-added to ADE/DEP without physical access and a tethered connection to Apple Configurator. Only release devices that are permanently leaving the organization.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Inventory Archiving</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not immediately delete the record from your MDM. Move it to a <strong>“Retired/Decommissioned”</strong> group for 12 months.</li>\n<li>Export a final report (Serial, Purchase Date, Retirement Date) to serve as an audit trail for asset disposal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. Sustainability &amp; ESG</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Second Life</strong>: If the hardware is functional but cannot support newer OS versions, consider repurposing it as a “Library E-reader” or a dedicated “Sign-in Kiosk.”</li>\n<li><strong>Certified Recycling</strong>: For damaged units, choose a certified e-waste recycler and mark the device as <strong>“Decommissioned”</strong> in ASM for ESG reporting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Summary Advice</h2>\n<p>A rigorous retirement process protects the school from data breaches and ensures your MDM license count remains accurate.

          "answer": "<p><strong>MDM should not just be a ‘restrictor,’ but a ‘guardrail’ for Digital Citizenship education. With the features in iOS 26, administrators can guide students toward responsible AI and technology habits.</strong></p>\n<h2>The New Role of MDM in Behavior Management</h2>\n<h3>1. Phased Access to Apple Intelligence</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Not just ON/OFF</strong>: Use <strong>Managed App Config</strong> to enable AI “Summarization” in science or history (to practice identifying key points) while disabling “Rewrite” in language arts (to practice original composition).</li>\n<li><strong>Contextual Boundaries</strong>: Use MDM to restrict features like <strong>iPhone Mirroring</strong> on student devices to teach the difference between “Personal” and “Educational” tool usage boundaries.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Reinforcing Focus via DDM</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Focus Patterns</strong>: Use DDM to push specific “Study Focus” modes that automatically hide social apps but allow teacher notifications. This helps students learn to build their own “Digital Focus” habits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Safari Distraction Control</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pedagogical Application</strong>: Safari 26 allows users to hide distracting web elements. Admins can use configuration profiles to suggest “Distraction-Free Views” for approved educational portals, and then use this as a class discussion topic on how “content filtering” versus “critical thinking” affects how we consume information.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Management Philosophy for IT Leads</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Periodically share anonymized data on app usage and traffic with the students. Help them understand that management is about <strong>“Protection,”</strong> not “Spying.”</li>\n<li><strong>Incremental Trust</strong>: For senior students or classes with high digital literacy scores, use MDM to gradually relax certain restrictions (e.g., allowing “AirDrop Codes”) as a reward for demonstrated digital maturity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Summary Advice</h2>\n<p>MDM provides the technical parameters, but education remains the core objective.

          "answer": "<p><strong>One of the iPad’s greatest strengths is its ‘Offline Productivity.’ Even without Wi-Fi, most pre-installed apps and downloaded content remain fully functional. The role of MDM is to pre-configure ‘Offline Grace Periods’ and ‘Local Caching’ to ensure teaching never stops.</strong></p>\n<h2>Strategies for Offline Teaching</h2>\n<h3>1. Pre-Class Preparation: Caching and Syncing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Content Caching</strong>: Ensure your school has a macOS <strong>Content Caching</strong> server. If the main internet line fails but the internal local network (LAN) is active, iPads can still download apps or updates from the local cache.</li>\n<li><strong>Asset Pre-loading</strong>: Use Jamf Pro to push “Essential Courseware” directly into the student’s <strong>Files</strong> app or <strong>Books</strong> beforehand, rather than relying on cloud links.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Handling the Outage in the Classroom</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Apple Classroom</strong>: As long as the teacher’s Mac/iPad and the students’ iPads are in the same room with Bluetooth and Peer-to-Peer Wi-Fi enabled, <strong>the Classroom app will still function</strong>. Teachers can still monitor screens and push PDFs or local bookmarks without any internet connection.</li>\n<li><strong>Creative Suite</strong>: Professional tools like Keynote, Pages, GarageBand, and Swift Playgrounds all support full offline editing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. MDM Configuration for Reliability</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Passcode Longevity</strong>: Set a long “Offline Check-in Grace Period” in your MDM settings. This prevents devices from locking students out if they haven’t “checked in” with the server for 24–48 hours due to a network outage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Administrator Backup SOP</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Bluetooth Awareness</strong>: Remind teachers that during an outage, they must keep Bluetooth ON for “Classroom” app peer-to-peer functions to work.</li>\n<li><strong>Hardwire Kits</strong>: Keep a set of Lightning/USB-C to Ethernet adapters and a laptop with <strong>Apple Configurator</strong> to manually inject Wi-Fi profiles if a device loses its configuration during a prolonged outage.</li>\n<li><strong>Offline Inventory</strong>: Maintain a physical or local PDF copy of your asset list (Serial Numbers and Wi-Fi MAC addresses) for manual troubleshooting.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Summary Advice</h2>\n<p>Network outages are inevitable. In the iOS 26 architecture, <strong>Declarative Device Management (DDM)</strong> is designed to keep the device in its “Last Known Good State,” ensuring that even without a cloud connection, the iPad remains a stable and predictable teaching tool.</p>\n",
