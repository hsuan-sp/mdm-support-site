          "question": "The system prompted to agree to 'New Terms and Conditions' when logging into Apple School Manager (ASM). Is this important?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>Yes, this is extremely important and should be prioritized immediately.</strong> When Apple updates its service terms, a “Terms and Conditions” window will pop up when you log into <a href=\"https://school.apple.com\">Apple School Manager (ASM)</a>. Ignoring this will impact several critical management functions.</p>\n<h2>The Impact of Not Agreeing</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Registration Blocked</strong>: New devices will fail the <strong>Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)</strong> process. Apple’s servers will reject registration requests from your organization until the terms are accepted.</li>\n<li><strong>VPP Sync Interruption</strong>: The synchronization of <strong>Volume Purchase Program (VPP)</strong> content will pause. You will be unable to assign new apps or book licenses to your devices.</li>\n<li><strong>Feature Lockout</strong>: You may lose access to newer administrative features, such as <strong>Apple Intelligence controls</strong> or the ability to view <strong>AppleCare coverage</strong> within your MDM dashboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Management Delays</strong>: While currently enrolled devices won’t stop working, you won’t be able to push any new configuration profiles or app updates to them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Who Can Accept the Terms?</h2>\n<p>Only users with the <strong>“Administrator”</strong> role in ASM have the authority to accept these terms. Users with “Content Manager” or “Site Manager” roles will see the notice but will not be able to clear it.</p>\n<h2>Practical Steps</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to <a href=\"https://school.apple.com\">school.apple.com</a> using your Administrator account.</li>\n<li>Follow the prompts in the banner or popup window.</li>\n<li>Read the terms, check the “I have read and agree…” boxes, and click <strong>“Agree.”</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Institutional Advice:</h2>\n<p>We recommend that every school has at least <strong>two separate Administrator accounts</strong> (e.g., the ICT Director and a designated systems administrator). This ensures that if one person is unavailable or leaves the school, global management of your Apple fleet can continue without interruption.</p>\n",

          "question": "What happens if our APNs Push Certificate expires? How do we renew it?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>The consequences are severe: Your MDM system will lose the ability to manage your devices entirely.</strong> The <strong>Apple Push Notification service (APNs)</strong> certificate is the “digital ID card” that allows your MDM (Jamf Pro) to talk to Apple’s servers. Every command—from installing an app to wiping a passcode—must be signed by this certificate.</p>\n<h2>What Happens if it Expires?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Total Loss of Control</strong>: Devices will not “leave” management, but they will become “unmanaged devices.” You will not be able to send any new profiles, apps, or commands.</li>\n<li><strong>The Point of No Return</strong>: If the certificate expires and you accidentally create a <strong>new</strong> one instead of <strong>renewing</strong> the old one, you will lose the link to all currently enrolled devices. You would then have to manually erase and re-enroll every single device in the school.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to Renew (Before Expiration):</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Preparation</strong>: Log in to Jamf Pro and navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; Global Management &gt; Push Certificates</strong>. Download the <strong>Certificate Signing Request (CSR)</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Apple Portal</strong>: Go to the <a href=\"https://identity.apple.com/pushcert\">Apple Push Certificates Portal</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Crucial Step</strong>: Log in with the <strong>EXACT SAME Apple ID</strong> used to create the original certificate. <em>Warning: If you use a different ID, you will create a new certificate rather than a renewal, which will break the connection to your existing iPads.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Renew</strong>: Find the certificate that matches your Jamf server, click <strong>“Renew,”</strong> and upload the CSR from Step 1.</li>\n<li><strong>Download &amp; Upload</strong>: Download the new <code>.pem</code> certificate from Apple and upload it back into Jamf Pro.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Institutional Advice:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use a Shared Account</strong>: Always create your push certificate using a generic school IT email (e.g., <code>MDM-admin@school.tp.edu.tw</code>) rather than a personal teacher’s Apple ID.</li>\n<li><strong>Calendar Alerts</strong>: Set multiple calendar reminders (3 months, 1 month, and 2 weeks before expiration) to ensure this task is never forgotten.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep Backup codes</strong>: Ensure the recovery phone number and backup keys for the management Apple ID are stored in the school’s secure password manager.</li>\n</ul>\n",

          "question": "Jamf Pro shows that the 'VPP Token' is about to expire. How do we update it?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>The VPP (Volume Purchase Program) Token is the secure bridge that syncs app licenses between Apple School Manager (ASM) and Jamf Pro. It must be renewed annually.</strong> If the token expires, Jamf Pro will lose the ability to fetch new licenses or update existing ones, causing app deployments to fail across the school.</p>\n<h2>Renewal Workflow:</h2>\n<h3>Step 1: Download the Token from ASM</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to <a href=\"https://school.apple.com\">school.apple.com</a> with “Administrator” or “Content Manager” privileges.</li>\n<li>Click your <strong>Account Name</strong> in the bottom-left corner and go to <strong>Preferences</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Payments and Billing</strong>.</li>\n<li>Find the <strong>Apps and Books</strong> section and locate your specific location (e.g., “Main Campus”).</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Download</strong> next to the VPP Token for that location. A <code>.vpptoken</code> file will be saved to your computer.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Step 2: Upload the Token to Jamf Pro</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your Jamf Pro dashboard.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; Global Management &gt; Volume Purchasing</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click on the entry for your location and select <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Upload</strong> and choose the <code>.vpptoken</code> file you just downloaded.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>. The status should now reflect a new expiration date one year in the future.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Troubleshooting Tips:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location Mismatch</strong>: If you have multiple sites in ASM, ensure you are downloading the token for the <em>same</em> location currently configured in Jamf. Using the wrong token will cause your license counts to drop to zero.</li>\n<li><strong>Manual Sync</strong>: After renewing, it is good practice to click the <strong>“Sync”</strong> button within Jamf Pro to ensure the immediate update of your app inventory.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Institutional Advice:</h2>\n<p>Schedule this task during the school summer break. Renewing your tokens as part of your “Annual IT Health Check” ensures that all classroom apps are ready to be deployed the moment teachers and students return in the autumn.</p>\n",

          "question": "My school uses Google Workspace / Microsoft 365. Can we use these IDs to sign into Apple services?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>Yes. This is called “Federated Authentication,” and it allows students and staff to use their existing school credentials to create and sign into Managed Apple Accounts.</strong> By linking Apple School Manager (ASM) with your Google Workspace or Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), you create a seamless “Single Sign-On” experience across all campus devices.</p>\n<h2>Key Benefits:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One Password</strong>: Users don’t need to remember a separate password for their iPad or Mac. They use their official campus login.</li>\n<li><strong>Automatic Provisioning</strong>: You can configure a <strong>SCIM</strong> bridge so that when a new student is added to Google or Microsoft, their Apple account is created automatically in ASM—no CSV imports required.</li>\n<li><strong>Security Alignment</strong>: Password policies and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) are managed by your primary identity provider (Google or Microsoft).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Technical Requirements:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Domain Verification</strong>: You must prove ownership of your school’s email domain (e.g., <code>@tes.tp.edu.tw</code>) within ASM by adding a specific TXT record to your DNS settings.</li>\n<li><strong>IdP Connection</strong>: An administrator must authorize the link within the ASM <strong>Preferences &gt; Directory Sync</strong> section.</li>\n<li><strong>Conflict Resolution</strong>: If staff members have previously used their school email to create <em>personal</em> Apple IDs, Apple will provide a 60-day window for them to change their personal email address to a private one before the school “takes over” that domain.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Operational Note:</h2>\n<p>Jamf Pro fully supports this through <strong>Platform SSO</strong> on macOS. When a teacher logs into their Mac for the first time, they simply use their Microsoft or Google credentials, and the system handles the rest. This drastically reduces the number of “I can’t log in” tickets for the ICT team.</p>\n",

          "question": "Can I migrate to a new MDM provider without wiping device data?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>While System Version 26 supports ‘Automated MDM Migration’, it remains ‘strongly discouraged’ in educational environments due to potential configuration conflicts.</strong></p>\n<p>According to the latest updates from WWDC 25, Apple has enhanced the <code>MigrateDevice</code> command in <strong>Version 26</strong> (iOS 26 / macOS 26 Tahoe), allowing devices to migrate silently from an old MDM to a new one. However, significant risks remain:</p>\n<h2>1. Educational Environment Constraints:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Profile Residue</strong>: Non-wipe migrations often lead to residual “Restriction Profiles” or “Education Settings” from the old MDM conflicting with the new one, potentially breaking Apple Classroom.</li>\n<li><strong>Data Integrity</strong>: Over time, student devices accumulate cache and temporary files. Without a clean reset, new MDM configurations may not apply correctly.</li>\n<li><strong>License Sync</strong>: VPP app licenses may fail to transition smoothly, preventing subsequent updates.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. Technical Context:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Devices must be updated to <strong>Version 26 (iOS/iPadOS 26, macOS 26 Tahoe)</strong> for the most stable “wipe-free” migration experience.</li>\n<li>While this feature has been significantly bolstered since WWDC 2025, a clean reset remains the recommended option for complex educational deployments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Practical Advice:</h2>\n<p>To ensure device stability for a new semester, we prioritize the <strong>Return to Service (RTS)</strong> feature. Introduced in iOS 17 and optimized in <strong>Version 26</strong>, RTS allows administrators to send a single command that wipes the device and automatically re-enrolls it using cached Wi-Fi credentials. Crucially, <strong>OS 26 supports retaining installed managed apps during the RTS process</strong>, providing a “clean, stable, and fully automated” transition.</p>\n",

          "answer": "<p><strong>If newly purchased devices do not appear in your MDM inventory, the most common reason is an expired ‘Server Token’ or unassigned devices in Apple School Manager (ASM).</strong></p>\n<p>The Server Token acts as the secure bridge between ASM and Jamf Pro for hardware management (formerly known as the DEP process). It is responsible for syncing purchase serial numbers from Apple to your MDM console.</p>\n<h2>Troubleshooting Steps:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Token Expiration</strong>: Server Tokens are valid for exactly one year. Once expired, Jamf Pro cannot fetch new serial numbers or update the enrollment status of existing ones from Apple.</li>\n<li><strong>Unassigned Devices</strong>: New devices must be assigned to your Jamf Pro “MDM Server” within ASM before Jamf Pro can “see” them.</li>\n<li><strong>Unaccepted Terms</strong>: As mentioned in <code>acc-1</code>, if new Apple terms and conditions have not been accepted, Apple will suspend all ADE synchronization activities.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How to Renew the Server Token:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to <a href=\"https://school.apple.com\">school.apple.com</a>.</li>\n<li>Click your name at the bottom left &gt; <strong>Preferences &gt; Your MDM Servers</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select your server and click <strong>Download Token</strong>.</li>\n<li>Log in to Jamf Pro, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Global Management &gt; Device Enrollment</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select your server instance and upload the new token file to complete the renewal.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Synchronization Context:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sync Now</strong>: While syncing occurs periodically, you can click “Sync Now” in Jamf Pro to force an immediate refresh after assigning devices in ASM.</li>\n<li><strong>Automation Trends</strong>: In modern OS versions, Apple has enhanced background push mechanisms. Synchronization typically occurs automatically within minutes of assignment in ASM, but “Sync Now” remains the go-to tool for manual troubleshooting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Practical Advice:</h2>\n<p>We recommend setting a “Default Device Assignment” in ASM for iPad and Mac.

User Interface and Localization</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jamf Pro</strong>: Offers full, official <strong>Traditional Chinese</strong> localization, making it more accessible for local technical staff and administrators.</li>\n<li><strong>Jamf School</strong>: As of late 2025, the administrative interface <strong>is not available in Traditional Chinese</strong>, supporting only English and several European languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. Management Logic and Technical Depth</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jamf Pro</strong>: Utilizes a “Smart Groups” and “Policies” mechanism. Beyond standard configuration profiles, it supports extensive custom <strong>Scripts</strong> and <strong>Extension Attributes</strong>, allowing for granular, low-level automation and management.</li>\n<li><strong>Jamf School</strong>: Designed specifically for K-12 environments with a simplified, intuitive interface. While it includes smart groups, its core focus is on the deployment of configuration profiles; its ability to execute low-level scripts is more limited compared to Jamf Pro.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3. Multi-Site Architecture and Scalability</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jamf Pro</strong>: Features a powerful <strong>“Sites”</strong> capability, allowing for completely independent management environments within a single server instance (e.g., a district managing the primary instance while individual schools manage their specific sites).</li>\n<li><strong>Jamf School</strong>: While it supports multi-school management, the depth of isolation and permissioning for global resource sharing is more streamlined.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4. API and Third-Party Integration</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jamf Pro</strong>: Boasts the most robust Classic and Pro APIs in the industry, enabling deep integration with external asset management systems, automated reporting tools, and identity providers.</li>\n<li><strong>Jamf School</strong>: Provides an API, but the structure and available data fields are more concise than those of Jamf Pro.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Practical Advice:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Choose Jamf Pro</strong>: If your institution requires a <strong>Traditional Chinese interface</strong>, involves large-scale multi-site management, or needs complex automation scripts and deep third-party system integrations.</li>\n<li><strong>Choose Jamf School</strong>: If your deployment scale is smaller, technical resources are limited, and your administrators are comfortable navigating an English-only interface.</li>\n</ul>\n",

This works at the system level, covering the Setup Assistant and System Settings, and provides robust data separation without relying solely on MDM profiles.</strong></p>\n<h2>Configuration Steps (Apple School Manager / Apple Business Manager)</h2>\n<p>This is an organization-level security policy that must be enabled by an <strong>Administrator</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Log in to <strong>Apple School Manager (ASM)</strong> or <strong>Apple Business Manager (ABM)</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to <strong>Access Management</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select <strong>Apple Services</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Find the option: <strong>‘Apple Account on Organization Devices’</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enable the option to <strong>‘Allow Only Managed Apple Accounts to Sign In’</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save settings.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once configured, this policy automatically applies to all eligible devices owned by the organization.</p>\n<h2>Technical Characteristics and Limitations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>System-Level Enforcement</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The restriction operates at the OS level and does not require a specific MDM configuration profile once the organization-level policy is set.</li>\n<li>It applies during the “Setup Assistant” phase and within “System Settings.”</li>\n<li>The device validates that the signing-in account domain matches the verified domains in your ASM/ABM.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>System Version Requirements</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requires <strong>iOS 26</strong>, <strong>iPadOS 26</strong>, <strong>macOS 26 (Tahoe)</strong>, or later.</li>\n<li>macOS 26 (Tahoe) was officially released on September 15, 2025.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Device Conditions</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Devices must be owned by the organization and managed via ASM/ABM.</li>\n<li>We recommend combining this with <strong>Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)</strong> and <strong>Supervised Mode</strong> for complete protection.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Deployment Advice</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Domain Verification First</strong>: Ensure your organization’s domains are verified in ASM/ABM before enabling this feature.</li>\n<li><strong>Account Preparation</strong>: Ensure Managed Apple Accounts are pre-created for all users via Federated Authentication (Google/Entra ID) or SCIM sync.</li>\n<li><strong>Functionality Trade-offs</strong>: Once enabled, personal features (personal App Store purchases, iCloud Photos, personal iMessage) will be unavailable on these devices. Evaluate if this aligns with your organizational policy.</li>\n<li><strong>Access Management Pairing</strong>: This feature can be paired with other “Access Management” settings in ASM/ABM to further restrict Managed Accounts to only log in on “Managed” or “Supervised” devices, creating a bidirectional security loop.</li>\n</ul>\n",

          "question": "How is the iCloud storage quota managed for Managed Apple Accounts? What if a student runs out of space?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>Managed Apple Accounts for education default to a 200GB iCloud storage quota. Administrators cannot adjust individual quotas or purchase additional space for specific users.</strong></p>\n<h2>Storage Quotas by Organization Type</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Education (ASM)</strong>: Apple provides <strong>200GB</strong> of iCloud storage for every user (staff and students) at no additional cost.</li>\n<li><strong>Business (ABM)</strong>: Defaults to 5GB. Organizations with <strong>Apple Business Essentials (ABE)</strong> may have 50GB or 200GB quotas. <em>Note: As of early 2026, ABE is not yet widely available in all regions (including Taiwan).</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Handling a Full 200GB Quota</h2>\n<p>If a student’s 200GB is full (often due to backing up large personal photo/video libraries), consider the following strategies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Utilize the ‘Schoolwork’ App</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Files submitted via the <strong>Schoolwork</strong> app (Pages, Keynote, video assignments) are managed separately from the student’s personal iCloud quota, reducing pressure on their individual space.</li>\n<li>Teach students to manage files effectively instead of storing all miscellaneous data in iCloud.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cleanup and Backup (SOP)</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check Backup Content</strong>: Go to Settings &gt; Apple Account &gt; iCloud &gt; iCloud Backup and disable backups for non-essential apps.</li>\n<li><strong>Offload Photos</strong>: Guide students to move non-academic photos to personal devices or a school-provided Google Photos account.</li>\n<li><strong>Purge Old Coursework</strong>: At the end of the semester, export important files to a school NAS or external storage and clear the iCloud space for the next term.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Alternative Cloud Services</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your school provides <strong>Google Workspace for Education</strong> or <strong>Microsoft 365</strong>, direct students to store large static files (like long-form video projects) on Google Drive or OneDrive.

          "question": "What automation tasks can be performed using ABM/ASM APIs? Does it require development skills?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>Apple provides APIs for ASM/ABM that allow developers to interact directly with organizational data, enabling advanced automations like “automated account creation,” “device inventory queries,” and “bulk MDM reassignment.”</strong></p>\n<h2>Key API Use Cases</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Roster Automation</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrate directly with the school’s <strong>SIS (Student Information System)</strong>. When a registrar adds a transfer student to the SIS, the Roster API can automatically create the corresponding Managed Apple Account in ASM and assign it to the correct Class and Location.</li>\n<li>This replaces traditional daily SFTP imports, achieving “real-time” synchronization.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Device Inventory &amp; Management</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Third-party asset management systems can use the Device API to query the list of devices in ASM/ABM, including their model, warranty status, and MDM assignment.</li>\n<li>Automate “MDM Server Assignment”: For example, detecting newly purchased iPads and automatically assigning them to the “Student MDM” based on the order number, while assigning Macs to the “Staff MDM.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Custom Reporting &amp; Data Export</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build customized dashboards or export device data to other internal systems for audit and analysis using API endpoints.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Technical Barriers &amp; Development Requirements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Does it require development skills? Yes.</strong></li>\n<li>Using these APIs requires proficiency in <strong>RESTful API</strong> integration, understanding of OAuth 2.0 authentication flows, and the ability to write code (e.g., Python, Node.js) to send requests and handle JSON responses.</li>\n<li>Typically, this level of automation is performed by <strong>large district IT departments</strong> or <strong>System Integrators (SI)</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Advice for Individual Schools</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>No need to build from scratch</strong>: Most mainstream MDM solutions (like Jamf Pro) and Identity Providers (like Microsoft Entra ID or Google Workspace) already have built-in integrations with the ASM API.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Leverage existing tools</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To sync accounts: Use Jamf Pro’s LDAP integration or Google Workspace Federation.</li>\n<li>To manage devices: Use the MDM console directly without writing custom code to call the ASM API.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>When is the API necessary?</strong> Only consider custom development if off-the-shelf software cannot meet a highly specific requirement, such as integrating with a proprietary homegrown school administration system.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

          "question": "How should iCloud+ features (e.g., Hide My Email, Private Relay) be managed for Managed Apple Accounts in schools?",
          "answer": "<p><strong>As Apple expands permissions for education users, modern ‘Managed Apple Accounts’ now enjoy benefit from certain advanced iCloud+ privacy features. However, in a school setting, these ‘Privacy Enhancements’ (such as Hide My Email and iCloud Private Relay) can sometimes conflict with network management and security auditing protocols.</strong></p>\n<h2>Feature Breakdown and Management Strategy</h2>\n<h3>1. iCloud Private Relay</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How it works</strong>: Encrypts DNS requests and HTTP traffic, masking the user’s IP and browsing activity from the ISP and network owner.</li>\n<li><strong>School Conflict</strong>: Bypasses school-level content filters and firewalls, making it difficult to block inappropriate content or monitor for cyberbullying.</li>\n<li><strong>MDM Recommendation</strong>: Use the <strong>Restrictions</strong> payload to disable <strong>‘Allow iCloud Private Relay’</strong>. This ensures student web traffic remains subject to the school’s safety policies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Hide My Email</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How it works</strong>: Generates random email addresses that forward to the user’s primary inbox, preventing third-party apps from knowing the student’s real email.</li>\n<li><strong>School Conflict</strong>: Can make it difficult for IT to identify which student signed up for a specific service or tool during an audit.</li>\n<li><strong>MDM Recommendation</strong>: While less critical than Private Relay, schools can disable <strong>‘Allow Hide My Email’</strong> if strict identity tracking is required for all approved educational apps.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. iCloud Private Email Domain</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How it works</strong>: Allows users to set up personal domains for iCloud Mail.</li>\n<li><strong>School Conflict</strong>: Not typically applicable to students as their domains are managed by the school.</li>\n<li><strong>MDM Recommendation</strong>: Generally disabled by default for Managed Apple Accounts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Expert Insight</h2>\n<p>For student devices, maintaining <strong>Network Visibility</strong> is the priority. We recommend disabling <strong>Private Relay</strong> via MDM to ensure your Content Filtering (DNS Proxy or Network Extension) remains effective. For teacher devices, you may choose to leave these features enabled to respect professional privacy.</p>\n",
