docs: re-organize maintenance bundles by category

- Deleted monolithic `complete_bundle` files.
- Generated new categorized bundles in `docs/maintenance/bundles/`:
  - `*_account_bundle.md`
  - `*_apps_bundle.md`
  - `*_classroom_bundle.md`
  - `*_digital-learning_bundle.md`
  - `*_enrollment_bundle.md`
  - `*_hardware_bundle.md`
  - `*_mac_bundle.md`
  - `*_qa-education_bundle.md`
- Split glossary into 3 parts per language for better manageability (`*_glossary_bundle_v1~v3.md`).
- Cleaned up root directory temporary files.
